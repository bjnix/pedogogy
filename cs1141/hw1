1) The 'script' command runs a program which makes a typscript of everything 
	printed to the terminal. EVERYTHING. Even backspaces.

chmod - a program that allows the user to change permissions on a file 

file - a program that allows the user to (through a series of tests) determine 
	the type of the specified file.

less - a text reader program that a user can pipe oversized output into in order
	to scroll through the results. since it does not have to read the entire
	file before displaying them, it runs faster on larger files than a text
	editor (like VI) would.

ls - used to the files contained in the directory that we run the program in

pwd - allows the user to print out the working directory for the current object
	in memory

touch - allows for the user to change the time stamp on a file (updating them, 
	not necessarily change them but update them.

-the file starts out with read, write, and executable permissions for the owner
	and the group with only read permissions given to the user. after the 
	change, the user gains write access and the group loses execute access.

I have the right to read, write or execute any of the files I create, but for 
objects made by my group or other users I only have executable permissions.

The 'principle of least privilege' is a concept which says that at every level
a no user should have more access or permission than they absolutely need.
The classic example of why this is important for the security of a computer is
restricting a user from having root access because in the very best situation,
a user can cause damage unintentionally and in the worst case, a knowledgeable
user has the ability to do whatever it is that their malicious hearts desire.
