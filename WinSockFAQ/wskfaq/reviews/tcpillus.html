<br clear=all>

<p>Do you understand TCP/IP? I mean <i>really</i> understand it? Most
Winsockers can get by with a basic understanding of stream protocols,
but at least one person in your organization should have a deep
knowledge of TCP/IP. Why not you?</p>

<p>TCP/IP, though elegant, has some interesting complexities, mainly
due to the various optimizations and reliability enhancements in the
protocol. Did you know that the connection sequence consists of three
precisely-specified packets? Do you know what happens if one of those
packets is lost, corrupted, duplicated or received out of order? Do you
understand what it means when the "netstat -a" command reports that
your server program is in the FIN_WAIT_2 state? Someone on your team
needs to, or else you&rsquo;ll just stumble around in the darkness,
never really grasping TCP/IP &mdash; worse, your programs will show
this, by being poorly-behaved.</p>

<p>Stevens writes wonderful books, and this one is no exception. It
is clear that he both understands his subject intimately, and takes
the time to write and rewrite his prose until his points are clear and
cogent. This book may not be the easiest read you&rsquo;ll tackle this
year, but it may be one of the most worthwhile. More importantly, the
book&rsquo;s 600-page bulk is not fluffed-up. It really does have to
be that big, so while it may take you awhile to get through this book,
you won&rsquo;t regret the fairly steep price tag &mdash; it&rsquo;s
worth it, because the book is <i>dense</i> with information.</p>


<h4>The Bottom Line</h4>

<p>Stevens spends a lot of time tinkering with Unix kernels,
particularly the network stacks, and it shows &mdash; the man knows
what he&rsquo;s talking about, and not from a purely theoretical
standpoint. He&rsquo;s made the mistakes, and he&rsquo;s fought the
same battles you&rsquo;re fighting now; moreover, he knows how to
get across to you what you need to know. If you want to learn the
deep secrets of TCP/IP, this is the way to do it.</p>


<h4>Companion Books</h4>

<p>There are two other related books by Stevens you need to
consider. First is <a href="../reviews/unpv1.html">Unix Network Programming 2/e</a>. This is more code, and
less theory. If you prefer to learn by tweaking code, this is the
way to go. Or, if you&rsquo;ve decided to go the theoretical way,
you may want to make <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/020163354X/winsockprogramme">TCP/IP Illustrated, volume 2</a> 
your next purchase. This next volume in the series lists and explains
all 15,000 lines of C code in the 4.3BSD TCP/IP stack.</p>
