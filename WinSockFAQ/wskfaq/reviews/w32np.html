<p>This book would be a "shovelware" book, if it wasn&rsquo;t so darned
good. You know the kind I mean: they cover twenty loosely-related
topics in as many chapters, are at least 1.5 inches thick, have at
least three coauthors who apparently only met once in a bar, and
<i>always</i> include a CD-ROM, packed with many, many megabytes
of things that have only a tenuous tie to the contents of the
book. They never seem to come from Addison-Wesley, though, and this
book doesn&rsquo;t mar that record.</p>

<p>In a way, this is the book that Jeffrey Richter could have written
instead of the classic <i>Programming Applications for Microsoft
Windows</i>, if he was more inclined to write about networking. Like
that must-have book, Davis' tome is big and eclectic. They even
cover some of the same topics: exception handling, memory management,
threading, synchronization, file I/O, DLLs, etc. What in the world
do those things have to do with network programming? Well, it makes
more sense if you think of this book as a kind of story. It&rsquo;s
the story of a programmer with minimal Win32 skills who eventually
becomes a master of the wild array of Microsoft networking APIs. That
programmer could be you.</p>

<p>Another way to look at this book is as a &ldquo;brain dump&rdquo;
(like a Unix core dump, only for humans) of a master Windows network
programmer. So, it includes not only a networking tutorial, it covers
all of the lower-level APIs that you will need to use the networking
APIs effectively. For example, an understanding of Win32 file I/O is
very helpful if you plan on using Winsock 2&rsquo;s overlapped I/O
mechanisms. Similarly, a knowledge of threading and synchronization
is essential for writing efficient network servers.</p>

<p>Of all this, I think that the shining gem adorning this book&rsquo;s
well-earned crown is the book&rsquo;s class library. Most Winsock
books don&rsquo;t even acknowledge C++, and those that do seem to
develop relatively weak class libraries, or use the &lt;shudder&gt;
Microsoft wrapper clases. That wasn&rsquo;t good enough for Davis, who
developed an extensive class library, and uses it entirely throughout
his book. It is good enough for both commercial development, and as an
"idea mine," from which you can extract the raw ideas you&rsquo;ll
need if you like to develop your own class libraries. This is a true
class library, and not a CAsyncSocket-esque collection of wrappers. For
example, in the File I/O chapter, Davis develops a COverlapped class,
which he later uses as a parent class for his named pipes and Winsock
classes.</p>

<p>Hidden away in the last part of the last chapter is a wonderful
benchmarking program that pits synchronous Winsock, overlapped Winsock,
CAsyncSocket, <a href="../articles/csocket.html">CSocket</a>, UDP, named pipes,
and RPC against each other. With it, you can find out which mechanism
really is the fastest. Each of these methods has its advantages and
disadvantages, of course, so you also have to weigh those against your
particular situation, but running this little wonder on your system
might well give you that last bit of information you need to decide
on an appropriate architecture for your next networking project.</p>

<p>In addition to topics enumerated above, this book also covers
mailslots, RPC, the LAN Manager API, Windows NT&rsquo;s security API,
the registry, and a number of other, lesser APIs. In a sense, this book
is a kind of cook book, and a good, quality one at that. You&rsquo;ll
want to have it on hand on the theory that it will have some ideas
you can use later, not because it will solve something for you right
now. On the other hand, if you don&rsquo;t yet know how to "cook,"
you&rsquo;ll want to look elsewhere.</p>

<p>Note that the book&rsquo;s release date puts it just barely after
the Windows NT 4.0 release, and just barely before the Winsock 2.0
release. It seems to carry its age well, but it&rsquo;s possible
that there are a few minor pitfalls that I did not discover. But,
like many other books I&rsquo;ve reviewed here, this book hasn&rsquo;t
yet been replaced by something newer that is also better.</p>


<h4>The Bottom Line</h4>

<p>The actual Winsock coverage in this book is good and clear, but
the rest of the book crowds it into a single 140-page chapter. Still,
I as I hinted above, if you are just getting into serious Win32
programming and want to focus on networking, you might pick up
this volume and Richter&rsquo;s <i>Programming Applications for
Microsoft Windows</i>. They would make a great core for a budding
Win32 library.</p>
