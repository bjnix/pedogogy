<p><i>Windows Sockets Network Programming</i> is the Winsocker&rsquo;s
acknowledged Bible. (Indeed, most seasoned Winsockers know what you
mean when you say "Quinn and Shute".) The reason why is simple: it
was written by Winsock experts, with care and intelligence. So many
books are simply whipped out to satisfy market demand, and padded
with fluff so that they take up more shelf space; neither applies
to this book. Bob Quinn, in particular, was deeply involved in the
Winsock 1.1 specification, helped with the Winsock 2 spec, and is
still involved in the Winsock world as the moderator of the <a
href="http://www.sockets.com/winsock2.htm#MailList">winsock-2
mailing list</a>, and the creator of the <a
href="http://www.sockets.com/">sockets.com</a> web site.</p>

<p>The book is not perfect. For one thing, its 1995 copyright date
is beginning to tell. When it was released, Winsock 2.0 was not even
close to being released (it took about another year), and Windows 95
was just beginning to gain acceptance as a desktop operating system
in the business world. Also, Microsoft had not yet destroyed the
desktop TCP/IP stack market. Companies like FTP Software, Netmanage,
and Hummingbird Software still had money-making TCP/IP stacks. Today,
all of these companies are either catering to legacy markets, or have
shifted their focus to other, related markets.</p>

<p>Yet, Winsock 1.1 remains relevant. Sure, Winsock 2.0 is sexy,
and there are some really cool features in the new API, but how many
programs are there that actually make use of them? With the arrival of
Windows 98, programs requiring Winsock 2.0 have a chance of survival,
but it will take a year or more for Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0
to penetrate the client market to a significant degree. Until then,
Winsock 1.1 remains the only sane API for many developers to program
to. (I should point out that, although the book concentrates on
Winsock 1.1, it does cover some Winsock 2.0 issues. However, this
is relegated to a single 25-page chapter at the end of the book,
and cannot be said to be anything but an overview. And, as the book
came out well before the specification, its treatment of Winsock 2.0
is not totally accurate, either.)</p>

<p>There is another factor that keeps this book relevant: a lack
of suitable replacements. As you can see from looking at the <a
href=".">main Reviews page</a>, there are quite a few Winsock
books out there, and most are at least adequate. But, none seem
to quite replace this classic. It&rsquo;s probably because, next
to the specification itself, no other work is as authoritative
about Winsock. Plus, the authors obviously truly understand TCP/IP
network programming. I have found that there are three levels to this
sort of understanding: a lack thereof, followed by a competence,
and finally true understanding. Quinn and Shute, along with a few
select other authors (W. Richard Stevens, in particular) both have
this understanding, and know how to communicate it.</p>

<p>Despite all that, the book does have one other minor problem,
and that is that it gets going rather slowly. It&rsquo;s not that
there&rsquo;s a lot of fluff in the text, but rather that the book
doesn&rsquo;t introduce a significant Winsock program until page 106,
and that program is a rather large GUI-based program. A better approach
might have been to use simpler console programs. Unfortunately, that
wasn&rsquo;t a very good option for the authors, because in 1995,
most of us still hadn&rsquo;t migrated to the Win32 world.</p>


<h4>The Bottom Line</h4>

<p>Don&rsquo;t make this your first Winsock book, unless you are
the sort who likes to learn something by first diving into a book
or three for a goodly while. Instead, find another good book, and
get up to speed on Winsock. Then later, if you should find yourself
still confused and feeling inadequate, read this one. The lights will
turn on.</p>

<p>One last comment on the book&rsquo;s age: it&rsquo;s a computer
book that&rsquo;s still in print after three years, as I write
this. `Nuff said.</p>
