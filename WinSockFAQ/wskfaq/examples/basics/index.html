<p>These examples show you how to implement several of the
<a href="../../articles/io-strategies.html">various I/O strategies</a> that Winsock
allows.</p>


<h3>The Echo Protocol</h3>

<p>Each example is either an echo client or an echo server. The servers
read everything they receive and send it back verbatim. The clients send
data to the server and check that the reply matches what was sent. The
client programs can wait a bit before shutting the connection down,
so that you can run multiple clients to test multi-connection servers.</p>

<p>The echo server idea lets us focus more on the structure of the program
and less on its function, and yet still provide a fairly functional
program. I could have chosen something more substantial, like a "chat"
program, but then you end up spending more time on user interface details
than on Winsock programming issues.</p>

<p>The clients will actually work with any echo server: the Windows NT
derivatives and most Unixes have an optional service that sits on port
7 and works just like my servers do. Because the echo service can be
harnessed to attack a network, most system administrators leave that
service disabled. You'll probably have to start such a server yourself
to do your testing.</p>


<h3>Structure and Philosophy</h3>

<p>Although these programs are "minimal" in the sense that they don't
do much, they are still complete in that they do all the proper error
checking, shut their connections down gracefully, are fully commented,
etc. Some thought has been given to making it easy to swipe pieces of
code from these examples.</p>

<p>These programs all follow the same form as much as possible. Any
time you find two functions named the same in two different examples,
you can be sure that they have the same purpose, so you can study them
comparatively. For example, you can study <code>AcceptConnection()</code>
in the basic and threaded servers to see how threads change the way you
accept client connections.</p>


<h3>Supported Compilers</h3>

<p>I've tested all of the console mode programs with the command
line compilers from Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 SP3, the free version
of Borland C++ 5.5, and the Cygwin 1.0 port of the GNU tools to Win32
(EGCS 1.12). The Makefile below is compatible with the make tools from
all three environments.</p>

<p>The GUI programs are built around MFC, and tested under Visual
C++ 5.0. The use of MFC is not an arbitrary decision: Aside from the
simplifications in MFC itself, these programs use some of my MFC-based
framework code which makes the examples more powerful and easier to
follow. If I wrote straight Win32 code, you'd end up with either weaker
examples, or harder-to-follow code.</p>


<h3>Common Program Files</h3>

<p>You should probably download all of these before you begin, because
all the console mode examples require all of these files. The GUI programs
require some of the files in this set, too.</p>

	<p class=inset><b><a href="Makefile">Makefile</a></b> - The Makefile that
	builds the console mode examples. (Not required, but makes
	building the examples easier.)</p>

	<p class=inset><b><a href="main.cpp">main.cpp</a></b> - The <code>main()</code>
	function for the console mode example programs. Parses the command
	line, initializes Winsock, calls the example's driver function,
	and then shuts Winsock back down.</p>

	<p class=inset><b><a href="ws-util.cpp">ws-util.cpp</a></b> - A set of Winsock
	utility functions used by all the example programs.</p>

	<p class=inset><b><a href="ws-util.h">ws-util.h</a></b> - Header file for
	ws-util.cpp.</p>


<h3>The Examples</h3>

<p>Each of these examples illustrates a particular design choice. You
can read more about the plusses and minuses of each choice in the FAQ
article <a href="../../articles/io-strategies.html">Which I/O Strategy Should I Use?</a>. Obviously, no one design choice is
best for all situations, or we would not have so many choices. Between
the article's advice and these concrete examples, you should be able to
make your decision fairly easily.</p>

<p>You can test each server's multi-connection handling by running
it in one command window and then running two or more instances
of <a href="../../examples/basics/basic-client.html">the basic client</a> from another
command window. The basic client has a shutdown delay that makes it
keep its connection open for a bit after it receives the reply from the
server. The delay gives you time to switch among a few command windows,
to run a client from each before the first clients start closing their
connections.</p>



	<p class=inset><b><a href="../../examples/basics/basic-client.html">Basic Blocking Client</a></b> -  A client that uses blocking
	sockets. This is the simplest of the programs here.</p>

	<p class=inset><b><a href="../../examples/basics/AsyncClient/index.html">Asynchronous I/O Client</a></b> -  A client that uses asynchronous
	sockets. This program is a GUI MFC program, but it does <i>not</i>
	use CAsyncSocket or its derivatives.</p>

	<p class=inset><b><a href="../../examples/basics/CASClient/index.html">CAsyncSocket-based Client</a></b> -  A client that uses MFC's asynchronous
	sockets wrapper class: CAsyncSocket.</p>

	<p class=inset><b><a href="../../examples/basics/basic-server.html">Basic Blocking Server</a></b> -  A simple server that uses blocking
	sockets.</p>

	<p class=inset><b><a href="../../examples/basics/threaded-server.html">Multithreaded Server</a></b> -  A server that sends each new connection
	off to its own thread to be handled while the main thread sits
	in a loop accepting connections.</p>

	<p class=inset><b><a href="../../examples/basics/select-server.html">select()-based Server</a></b> -  A server that handles many connections
	using the <code>select()</code> function to manage them all within a
	single thread.</p>
