<h4>About the GUI Framework</h4>

<p>This example is based on the "MFCConsole" framework. Between that
base and the FAQ-specific extensions, there are 1800 lines of generic
framework code, neatly separated from the specific parts of each example
based on it. You do not need to understand this framework to learn from
the examples, but if you are interested, you can find information about
the framework on the <a href="/mfcconsole/">MFCConsole page</a>.</p>

<p>The example framework has two main menu items: "Start Winsock Handler"
(Ctrl-W), and a generic "Action" item (Ctrl-A). When you give the
Start command, it calls <code>DoWinsock()</code> &mdash; this is similar to
the console programs' <code>DoWinsock()</code> mechanism. The main difference
in the GUI version is that <code>DoWinsock()</code> doesn't call the network
handling functions directly: it just creates the object that does the
real work. Then you give the Action command to do whatever specific
thing the example does.</p>

<h4>The Unique Bits</h4>



<p>The unique parts of this example are in the CAsyncClientWnd class. That
class derives from CNetworkDriver, a generic interface that the framework
calls when you give the Start and Action commands mentioned above.</p>

<p>The <code>Start()</code> function in this example looks up the server's
address and establishes the network connection to the server. Then the
<code>Action()</code> function sends a packet for the server to echo back,
and reads/verifies the reply. If the Action command is given again,
another send/read sequence occurs. Then when the user closes the window,
the connection is gracefully shut down.</p>

<p>That's more or less what the simpler <a href="../../../examples/basics/basic-client.html">basic
blocking client</a> does. The tricky bit, though, is that Winsock never
<a href="../../../glossary.html#blocking">blocks</a> when all of this is going on. Whenever
Winsock can, it does what we ask it to immediately, but most everything
on the network takes time. So, rather than stop the program to wait on
the network, Winsock lets us go back to handling the UI while it waits
for the network operation to complete. When it does, Winsock sends us
a window message to tell us the result. This means we can handle both
networking and the UI in a single thread, but it does make the program
harder to write.</p>

<p>Here's a detailed breakdown of the run sequence:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The user gives the example framework's Start command. The
	example framework pops up a dialog box to get the server's address
	and port number.<pbr>
	
	<li>If the user hits OK in that dialog, the framework calls
	<code>DoWinsock()</code>, which creates CAsyncClientWnd, the window
	object that contains the async client code.<pbr>

	<li>The framework calls <code>CNetworkDriver::Start()</code>, which our
	subclass overrides. It just saves the address and port given,
	and does a DNS lookup on the address. The lookup almost always
	takes some time, so we usually just exit <code>Start()</code> without
	actually opening the connection to the server.<pbr>

	<li>When Winsock gets the host IP back from DNS, it calls our
	<code>OnWinsockLookup()</code> message handler. If it was a successful
	lookup, we call <code>EstablishConnection()</code>.<pbr>

	<li><code>EstablishConnection()</code> creates the socket, marks it as an
	asynchronous I/O socket, and attempts the connection. Again, this
	almost always takes some time, so we exit without having connected,
	and wait for Winsock to tell us whether it could connect or
	not.<pbr>

	<li>When the server accepts the connection, Winsock calls our
	<code>OnWinsockNotify()</code> message handler. This is the core of the
	asynchronous I/O handling: this message handler gets called for
	connections, disconnections, "data ready to read" events, and "okay
	to write" events. It also gets called for errors that happen
	asynchronously, like "connection refused by server". This time
	through, we get an FD_CONNECT notification, which just causes us to
	print a message saying that we're connected. Notice that we also get
	an FD_WRITE notification, which simply means Winsock is ready to
	handle <code>send()</code>s.<pbr>

	<li>Once the connection is established, the user can give the Action
	menu command. In this program, that means "send the echo request".
	We give the echo packet to Winsock, which it will deliver to the
	server as soon as it can. Meanwhile, we go back to waiting for
	window messages. (Note that the <code>SendEcho()</code> function isn't as
	smart as it might be: it's possible for <code>send()</code> to only queue
	up part of the buffer we give it. It's much rarer than the similar
	case with <code>recv()</code> but it can happen.)<pbr>

	<li>The server will receive the data and send it back. This will
	cause Winsock to send us an FD_READ notification. We read in the
	reply and check it, almost exactly like we do in the other clients'
	<code>ReadReply()</code> functions.<pbr>

	<li>Because this client is event driven, we can allow the to
	user give the Action command as many times as they want. Goto line
	7. :)<pbr>

	<li>When the user gets tired of bouncing packets off the server,
	he can exit the program. This is another tricky part of the
	example, because we have to close the connection down gracefully
	before we exit. Like many other operations with asynchronous
	sockets, <code>shutdown()</code> only starts the shutdown process:
	we have to wait for an FD_CLOSE notification to know that the
	connection is really shut down. Meanwhile, we ignore window
	close requests.<pbr>

	<li>Eventually the FD_CLOSE notification arrives. If we see that the
	UI is waiting for a close notification message, we send it. The UI
	then says "okay, I can shut down now". It does, and that's the end
	of our little adventure.<pbr>

</ol>


<h4>The Code</h4>

<p>This client program has about 330 <a href="../../../glossary.html#LOC">lines of code</a>,
compared to about 150 in the <a href="../../../examples/basics/basic-client.html">basic blocking
client</a>. That's the tradeoff for getting a program that handles
both the GUI and the network in a single thread without either blocking
the other.</p>

<p>The <a href="AsyncClient.zip">project package</a> (33 KB) is
a complete Visual C++ 5.0 project. It includes everything you need to
build the sample.</p>

<h4>License</h4>

<p>Note that this example program is released under a different <a
href="LICENSE">license</a> than the other example programs. It's a
BSD-style license, which means you can do anything you want with the
example so long as you don't sue me or my employer. Not even if it
prints 500 pages of personal insults on your customer's high-speed
laser printer.</p>
