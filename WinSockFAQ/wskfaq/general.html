<h5>1.1 - What is Winsock?</h5>

<p>&ldquo;Winsock&rdquo; is short for Windows Sockets, referring
to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets">BSD
Sockets API</a> it is derived from.</p>

<p class="aside"><b>Aside</b>: You may find old or pedantic material
using the original camel-case form, WinSock. Microsoft spells it
&ldquo;Winsock&rdquo; these days, and this FAQ has done so since <a
href="intro.html#aboutme">I</a> took on the maintenership role.</p>

<p>The Winsock specification defines a network programming interface
for Microsoft Windows which is based on the &ldquo;socket&rdquo;
paradigm popularized in <a href="./glossary.html#BSD">BSD&nbsp;Unix</a>. It
encompasses both familiar Berkeley socket style routines and a set
of Windows-specific extensions:

<ol>
  <li><p>Winsock 1 apps can ask Winsock to send notifications in
  window messages. This allows your program to handle both the network,
  UI issues, and background processing without having to worry about
  concurrency.</p></li>

  <li><p>Winsock 2 adds many features. <a href="#ws2additions">See
  below</a> for details.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Winsock 2.<i>x</i> defines two interfaces: an application
programming interface (API) which shields application developers from
underlying layers, and a service provider interface (SPI) which allows
transparent extensions to a Winsock stack. Through proper use of the
API, a Winsock application can work over various network transport
protocols and Winsock implementations.</p>

<p>(By the way, most people just say &ldquo;Winsock 2&rdquo; when
speaking of the current version of Winsock, because the newer versions
just contain edits and clarifications to the original spec.)</p>

<p>Today, the best specification for Windows Sockets is simply the
Winsock material in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/">MSDN</a>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/">Library</a>. You
may come across a separate spec document, but this is essentially
<a href="./articles/history.html">irrelevant</a> these days.</p>

<a name="tcp-vs-winsock"></a>
<h5>1.2 - What&rsquo;s the difference between Winsock and TCP/IP?</h5>

<p>Networks are made of several layers. Network people talk about those
layers in terms of the <a href="./glossary.html#osi-model">OSI network model</a>.</p>

<p>TCP/IP is a network protocol, meaning that it is at layers 3
through 4 in the OSI model. A network protocol provides services
like <a href="./glossary.html#addressing">addressing</a>, data transport, <a href="./glossary.html#routing">routing</a>, and
logical connections across a network. Two computers must use the
same network protocol if programs running on those computers are to
communicate. Other common network protocols include Novell&rsquo;s IPX,
3Com/IBM/Microsoft&rsquo;s NetBIOS and Apple&rsquo;s AppleTalk. TCP/IP
is the most popular network protocol today: virtually all computers
support it.</p>

<p>Winsock is an API that lets a Windows program send data over any
network transport protocol. There are several functions in Winsock
that only work with TCP/IP (e.g. <code>gethostbyaddr()</code>), but there
are newer generic versions of all these in Winsock 2 which allow you
to use other transports.</p>


<a name="ws2additions"></a>
<h5>1.3 - What does Winsock 2 have that Winsock 1.1 doesn&rsquo;t?</h5>

<p>One of the most important new features is official support for
multiple transport protocols. Although Winsock 1.1 was not actually
limited to TCP/IP, that was the only protocol that had official
support written into the spec. There was no standard way for a vendor
to add support for another transport protocol, though a few vendors
did do proprietary implementations of other protocols. With Winsock 2,
official support for OSI, Novell IPX/SPX and Digital&rsquo;s DECNet
exists in the spec, and it&rsquo;s now possible to add support for
other protocols in a standard way. More importantly, a program can
be written to be transport-independent, so that it works with all of
these protocols, without change.</p>

<p>Winsock 2 also adds support for technical initiatives like
<i>quality of service</i> (QoS) and <i>multicasting</i>. These
technologies will become increasingly important as bandwidth
requirements become more regimented and intense. For example,
QoS allows a videoconferencing program to reserve a certain
amount of bandwidth so that a sudden file transfer, for example,
doesn&rsquo;t cause its video to begin breaking up due to a lack of
bandwidth. Multicasting allows that videoconferencing application to
send audio and video streams to many participants without duplicating
data any more than absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Winsock 2 works with Win32&rsquo;s high-efficiency overlapped I/O
mechanism. Since this is handled entirely in the kernel in modern
versions of Windows, there are significant speed advantages over the
more traditional I/O styles supported by Winsock 1.1.</p>

<p>Winsock 2 also allows for &ldquo;Layered Service Providers.&rdquo;
This enables many neat things, such as security plug-ins: drop in,
say, an SSL service provider, and all of a sudden your data is
automatically encrypted.</p>

<p>There are a number of other additions to the spec. You
can get a complete list of them on sockets.com&rsquo;s <a
href="http://www.sockets.com/winsock2.htm#OverView">Winsock 2
Overview</a> page.</p>


<a name="nextrev"></a>
<h5>1.4 - When is the next rev of the specification due out?</h5>

<p>For reasons I discuss <a href="./articles/history.html">elsewhere</a>,
there is no longer a need for new Winsock specifications. The current
specification for Winsock is simply &ldquo;whatever Microsoft stacks
do today.&rdquo; Microsoft now documents these things in the MSDN
Library, not a separate spec. (Of course, Windows has undocumented
features, too.)</p>

<p>Winsock is not the only place Microsoft adds new networking
functionality. Sometimes they create entirely new APIs, like IP
Helper, or the Internet Explorer ActiveX control. These complement
Winsock without directly affecting it. Sometimes, they aren&rsquo;t
even based on Winsock, instead talking to lower-level APIs like the
TDI or NDIS layers.</p>

<a name="transport"></a>
<h5>1.5 - Can Winsock speak { DECNet, IPX/SPX, etc. }?</h5>

<p>Winsock 1.1 only had support for TCP/IP in the spec. Several
vendors&rsquo; Winsock 1.1 stacks did have support for other
transports, but the point is that this was never standardized in the
Winsock 1.1 specification.</p>

<p>Winsock 2 standardized support for DECNet, IPX/SPX and OSI
transports, and the spec defines a standardized way for adding support
for additional transports.</p>
