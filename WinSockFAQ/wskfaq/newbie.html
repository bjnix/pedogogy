<h5>2.1 - Which sockets API should I target?</h5>

<p>From the programmer&rsquo;s standpoint, there are two major
versions of Winsock, 2.0 and 1.1. These are the version numbers
you pass to <code>WSAStartup()</code>, and your choice affects whether
you <tt>#include&nbsp;&lt;winsock2.h&gt;</tt> and link against
<tt>ws2_32.dll</tt> or you <tt>#include&nbsp;&lt;winsock.h&gt;</tt>
and link against <tt>wsock32.dll</tt>. You could choose to declare
your program as using some other minor version, but unless you know
for a fact that you need to use something different, I recommend
using only 1.1 or 2.0, for best compatibility.</p>

<p>The Winsock design is a series of additions to older technologies,
not something wholly new. Winsock 2.0 is mostly a strict superset
of Winsock 1.1, and Winsock 1.1 is mostly a strict superset of BSD
Sockets. (In both cases, there are some things left behind or which
simply change. I cover these things elsewhere in the FAQ.)</p>

<p>The older APIs are still quite useful. If your program doesn&rsquo;t
need anything added in later versions of the API, it&rsquo;s perfectly
fine to limit your program to only Winsock 1.1 or to portable BSD
Sockets.</p>

<p>The Winsock 1.1 specific DLLs are still provided on
the newest versions of Windows. Winsock 1.1 has some <a
href="general.html#ws2additions">limitations</a> compared to Winsock 2,
but there are few types of programs that absolutely require Winsock
2 features.</p>

<p>Likewise, BSD Sockets, though a very old API now, still
contains a large amount of functionality. Most network programs
running today on Linux, Unix, and OS X still use nothing but
the plain old BSD Sockets API. Viewed that way, even Winsock 1.1
looks modern, new, and powerful. If your program doesn&rsquo;t
need any of the Windows-specific extensions, or simply has
to be portable to these other operating systems, feel free to
stick to the BSD Sockets subset of the API. There are some <a
href="articles/bsd-compatibility.html">details</a> that prevent you
from simply recompiling a BSD Sockets program on Windows, but these
are generally easy to work around.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of any penalty for choosing an older API on a
newer operating system. Nor for that matter am I aware of penalties for
using an older API subset while building your program against Winsock
2. There is the decreased portability, of course, but since there
are Winsock 2 options for OSes going back 14 years now, it&rsquo;s
not generally a practical concern.</p>

<p>The FAQ&rsquo;s example programs are all set up to build as Winsock
2 code just to be <a href="intro.html#versions">modern</a>. (Again,
14 years!) That said, you could easily make most of them build against
Winsock 1.1 simply by changing the things mentioned at the top of
this FAQ item.</p>


<a name="samples"></a>
<h5>2.2 - Are there any sample apps on the Net?</h5>

<p>Yes. There are several listed on the
<a href="./resources/samples.html">Resources</a> page, and the FAQ&rsquo;s
<a href="./examples/index.html">Examples</a> section has several more. If
you&rsquo;re just getting started with Winsock, you may be especially
interested in <a href="./examples/basics/index.html">these</a> samples.</p>

<a name="initwsadata"></a>
<h5>2.3 - Do I need to initialize the WSAData structure before calling WSAStartup?</h5>

<p>No, <code>WSAStartup()</code> fills this structure in for you.</p>

<a name="linkerror"></a>
<h5>2.4 - I&rsquo;m getting link errors when compiling Winsock programs. What&rsquo;s wrong?</h5>

<p>You&rsquo;re most likely not linking with the proper Winsock
import library. This is <tt>ws2_32.lib</tt> if you&rsquo;re targetting
Winsock 2, or <tt>wsock32.lib</tt> for Winsock 1.1.</p>


<a name="interop"></a>
<h5>2.5 - If I write a Winsock program, will I be able to communicate with a Unix sockets program?</h5>

<p>Absolutely! This common question is the result of confusing protocols
with the APIs. Communicating programs need not have been created with
the same APIs, as long as they are using the same transport and network
protocols.</p>

<p>Before dealing with cross-platform networking, please read the
FAQ article <a href="./articles/effective-tcp.html">How to Use TCP Effectively</a>. It covers several issues
that bite cross-platform programs, like structure padding and data
representation.</p>

<a name="langcompat"></a>
<h5>2.6 - Can I use Winsock with { My Favorite Language }?</h5>

<p>Maybe, but Winsock is usually only used directly in low-level
languages like C and its close relatives. There are several reasons
for this.</p>

<p><b>Reason 1:</b> Some languages simply lack the language features
to call the Winsock API directly.</p>

<p>A programming language needs the following features to access
Winsock:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Pointers. (The ability to access a specific piece of
	memory by its address.)</p></li>

	<li><p>Bitwise operators. (The ability to change specific
	bits in a byte.)</p></li>

	<li><p>Structures or records. (The ability to define a block
	of memory that is an aggregate of simple data elements, such
	as two characters followed by a 16-bit integer. This feature
	must also allow some measure of control as to how the data
	is laid out in memory.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Most high-level languages lack one or more of these features. Your
language might have some kind of extension mechanism that lets you
write code in C or a similar language to provide a bridge, but that
is usually not necessary.</p>

<p><b>Reason 2:</b> Most modern languages commonly used on Windows
provide network support as part of the language or its runtime. This
is typical of cross-platform languages like Java, Perl, Python, Tcl,
Ruby, Lua... Even more specialized languages, like R, Mathematica,
and Erlang usually include network support. Unless you are using a
language without network support built in or need to dig into some
Winsock-specific mechanism not exposed by the language&rsquo;s network
support, you won&rsquo;t have cause to use Winsock directly. Using
the language&rsquo;s own network API usually results in smaller,
more portable code.</p>

<p><b>Reason 3:</b> Older languages often didn&rsquo;t have networking
as part of the language, but had some extension mechanism whereby
networking was later added. A good example is old versions of
Visual Basic, and the now-moribund market for ActiveX networking
controls. Other than this external component difference, the argument
follows that for Reason 2.</p>

<p>For these reasons and others, this FAQ is
<a href="./intro.html#langbias">biased towards C and C++</a>. It
probably also applies just as well to other close C family members
like Objective C and D, but I don&rsquo;t use those, so I haven&rsquo;t
tried to ensure code compatibility.</p>

<p>If your language allows direct access to the Winsock API, you may
be able to translate the C++ code in the FAQ into equivalent code
in your chosen language. However, you&rsquo;ll probably do better
to try and find sample code in your chosen language elsewhere on the
net. You may be able to find something that does exactly what you need,
and if not, at least you will have a basis in your language&rsquo;s
network APIs which will make it easier to translate the code here
into your language.</p>

<a name="debugtools"></a>
<h5>2.7 - Are there any tools available for debugging Winsock programs?</h5>

<p>The two main categories of debugging tools are sniffers and
shims.</p>

<p><b>Sniffers</b></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve moved all discussion of what sniffers are, their
limitations, and workarounds for those limitations into a separate
article, &ldquo;<i><a href="./articles/sniffer.html">The Straight Dope on Packet Sniffers</a>.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The main advantage of a sniffer is that it literally sees every bit
of data in a network conversation, way down below the Winsock level
to the network hardware&rsquo;s protocol layer. (e.g. Ethernet)
Another advantage is that a good sniffer is quite powerful and
configurable. For example, some allow you to write &ldquo;protocol
plugins&rdquo; that will decode any protocol, such as a custom protocol
that you&rsquo;ve developed. You can also build complex expressions
to filter out just the small bit of traffic you need to see to debug
a problem, so you don&rsquo;t have to wade through the torrent of
variegated data on a modern LAN.</p>

<p>By far, the most popular packet sniffer today is the open source
and cross-platform <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>
suite. (Previously called Ethereal.) In the same way that Firefox
slowly, unevenly, yet inevitably steamrolled its commercial
competition, Wireshark has pushed out all but the very best commercial
offerings. It is not perfect, but it is more than good enough for
day-to-day packet sniffing; I use it <a href="#tcpdump">almost</a>
exclusively.</p>

<p>The main commercial sniffers left are WildPackets&rsquo; <a
href="http://www.wildpackets.com/products/network_analysis/omnipeek_network_analyzer">OmniPeek</a>,
Network Instruments&rsquo; <a
href="http://www.networkinstruments.com/products/observer/">Observer</a>,
and NetScout&rsquo;s <a
href="http://www.netscout.com/products/sniffer_analysis.asp">Sniffer</a>.
(An ancestor of the latter is the source of the now-kleenexed term
&ldquo;sniffer.&rdquo;) These all cost north of US$ 1,000 and run
into deep the thousands for enhanced versions and optional add-ons. I
haven&rsquo;t used any of them in many years, so I cannot advise about
the conditions where they are worth the cost. (They must be, else
they would not have survived this long in the face of a good-enough
free alternative.)</p>

<a name="tcpdump"></a>
<p>The only other sniffer I use is <a
href="http://www.tcpdump.org/">tcpdump</a>. Its main virtue is
that it&rsquo;s installed by default on almost every Linux, Unix
and OS X box out there. You can usually find such a box somewhere
nearby when you need to debug something. I almost never use it to
analyze captured packets; its display format is difficult to read
and often doesn&rsquo;t tell you enough besides. Instead, I use its
<code>-w</code> option to write the captured packets to a file, which
I then compress, transfer back to my PC, then load up in Wireshark
for analysis. I can do this even when not on-site with the problem
by dialing or <code>ssh</code>ing into a *ix box on site. Beware
that you might need to give the <code>-s</code> option to get it to
capture more than just the packet headers.</p>

<p>You can use Wireshark&rsquo;s <code>tshark</code> command-line
companion for this instead, if available. Its output format is more
readable and it captures whole packets by default.</p>


<p><b>Shims</b></p>

<p>Another major category of debugging tools are shims. (Also called
spies.) A shim uses any of several different methods to monitor a
single application&rsquo;s use of the Winsock APIs. Shims present
a higher-level view of your program&rsquo;s network interactions
than sniffers.</p>

<p>The difference in perspective can make it easier to map what it
displays onto what you know your program is trying to do. Captured
packets are sometimes too far removed from the problem source to
be immediately helpful.</p>

<p>(The reverse can be true, too: knowing the sequence of API calls
doesn&rsquo;t tell you every detail about the data that is actually
going out on the wire. Sniffers tell you that.)</p>

<p>Shims can sometimes work where sniffers will not. Some types of
point-to-point links (e.g. PPP over a modem) are sniff-resistant
due to their nature, but if they&rsquo;re exposed to Winsock, a
shim can see them. Some types of shims work in such a way that they
don&rsquo;t require administrator privileges on the local machine,
unlike most sniffers.</p>

<p>The main shims available are Systems Software Technology&rsquo;s <a
href="http://www.sstinc.com/winsock.html">TracePlus/Winsock</a>
(US&nbsp;$160) and WinTECH&rsquo;s <a
href="http://www.win-tech.com/html/socktspy.htm">SocktSpy</a>
(US&nbsp;$60).</p>



<p><b>Miscellaneous Tools</p></b>

<p>There are various other network debugging tools out there useful to
programmers.</p>

<p>Every network programmer needs a port scanner, with which you
can probe a machine to learn what ports are open, what ports
are closed or blocked by a firewall, even what OS a remote
machine is running based on how it responds to the scanning
packets. One nice GUI tool of that sort is Atelier Web&rsquo;s <a
href="http://www.atelierweb.com/pscan/">Security Port Scanner</a>,
a.k.a. AWSPS. (US&nbsp;$34 to 120, depending on options) A
more powerful but less pretty open source alternative is <a
href="http://nmap.org/">Nmap</a>.</p>

<p>Another useful class of tool is something that tells you
which programs on a given machine are listening on which
ports. Merely knowing that <i>something</i> is listening on
TCP port 8472 isn&rsquo;t as useful as knowing <i>what</i>
is listening on that port. AWSPS does this, as well. One
free but closed-source tool to do this is SysInternals&rsquo; <a
href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897437.aspx">TCPView</a>.
Another is <a
href="http://www.foundstone.com/us/resources/proddesc/vision.htm">Vision</a>,
from security firm Foundstone. In Windows XP and up, you can
get a primitive form of this information at the command line
by saying <code>netstat&nbsp;-ba</code>. The <code>-b</code>
option is Windows-specific; to get the same information on Linux,
BSD, and OS X systems, look into the awesome <code>lsof</code>
command. (The example question posed above would be answered with
<code>lsof&nbsp;-i:8472</code>.)</p>


<p><b>General Advice</b></p>

<p>No one tool will do everything you need. You might use a port
scanner to check for an open port, start a sniffer capturing packets on
that port, point your program at it, capture the data, then go back and
run it through a shim to find out why the API calls you&rsquo;re making
are giving you a some weird network packets the sniffer captured.</p>

<p>I suggest that you start with Wireshark, Nmap and TCPView, then
explore the commercial alternatives&rsquo; demos to see if they add
any features you just gotta have. I find less use for shims myself,
but that may be a result of long experience; I rarely find myself at
a loss to explain why a particular packet capture was produced by a
given program.</p>

<p>You may also find the FAQ article <a href="./articles/debugging-tcp.html">Debugging TCP/IP</a>
useful for some less-automated methods of debugging a TCP program.</p>


<p><b>Methods That Don&rsquo;t Work</b></p>

<p>There are a couple of debugging tools that are supposed to work
that don&rsquo;t, or are too flaky to deal with. The first is the
<code>SO_DEBUG</code> socket option. It simply doesn&rsquo;t work
on Microsoft stacks. The other is the Winsock DLL debugging plugin
<tt>dt_dll.dll</tt>; this method is flaky. Bob Quinn wrote an article
about this, but unfortunately the site that held it was bought by
another company that hasn&rsquo;t yet made that article available
again.</p>

<a name="errmsg"></a>
<h5>2.8 - How do I get a readable error message from a Winsock error number?</h5>

<p>The problem with this question is that it assumes that there is
a &ldquo;good&rdquo; canned error message for every situation. The
reality is that many times, you need to know the program&rsquo;s
context before you can turn an error value into a meaningful error
message. For example, <code>WSAEFAULT</code> can mean any of the
following, depending on context:</p>

<ul>
    <li>bad pointer passed</li>
    <li>passed buffer too small</li>
    <li>that version of the API is not supported</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the Winsock docs tell you the most likely error values
that each function will return, you should use this information to
construct intelligent error handlers.</p>

<p>Still, sometimes an API call returns something unexpected,
so a cryptic error message is better than none at all. For such
&ldquo;default&rdquo; case handling the <code>FormatMessage()</code> API
on all <a href="intro.html#versions">modern</a> versions of Windows
(except NT 4) will return canned messages when given Winsock error
numbers.</p>

<p>I must stress that you&rsquo;re better off spending your time
constructing meaningful error messages based on program context than
chasing something that doesn&rsquo;t work very well even in the best
case. Use canned messages only when your program has no better idea
what to do about an error.</p>


<a name="wouldblock"></a>
<h5>2.9 - Winsock keeps returning the error <code>WSAEWOULDBLOCK</code>. What&rsquo;s wrong with my program?</h5>

<p>Not a thing. <code>WSAEWOULDBLOCK</code> is a perfectly
normal occurrence in programs using non-blocking and asynchronous
sockets. It&rsquo;s Winsock&rsquo;s way of telling your program
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that right now, because I would have to
<a href="./glossary.html#blocking">block</a> to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next question is, how do you know when it&rsquo;s safe to try
again? In the case of asynchronous sockets, Winsock will send you
an <code>FD_WRITE</code> message after a failed <code>send()</code> call
when it is safe to write; it will send you an <code>FD_READ</code>
message after a <code>recv()</code> call when more data arrives on that
socket. Similarly, in a non-blocking sockets program that uses
<code>select()</code>, the <code>writefds</code> will be set when it&rsquo;s
okay to write, and the <code>readfds</code> will be set if there is
data to read.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t count on Winsock to handle blocking the way you think
it ought to. Whenever you use some form of nonblocking sockets,
you have to be prepared for <code>WSAEWOULDBLOCK</code> at any
time. It&rsquo;s simply a matter of defensive programming, just like
checking for null pointers.</p>


<a name="localhost"></a>
<h5>2.10 - How can I test my Winsock application without setting up a network?</h5>

<p>There is a special address called the <i>loopback</i> or
<i>localhost</i> address, 127.0.0.1. This lets two programs running
on a single machine talk to each other. The server usually listens
for connections on all available interfaces, and the client connects
to the localhost address. (See the <a href="./examples/index.html">Example Programs</a> section for
basic client and server program code.)</p>

<p>If you have an Internet or LAN connection on your development
machine, you&rsquo;re already set up for this.</p>

<p>For machines with no network at all, you
have to set up a &ldquo;dummy&rdquo; network. On <a
href="intro.html#versions">modern</a> versions of Windows, you can
go into the Network control panel, tell it to add an interface, and
select the Microsoft Loopback Device. You don&rsquo;t need any other
networking support for this to work.</p>

<p>Be warned: behavior through the loopback interface <i>will</i>
differ from that on a &ldquo;real&rdquo; network, if only because
conditions are much simpler within a single machine than over a LAN
or WAN. You should try to test your application on a real network,
even if you do primary development on a single machine.</p>


<a name="howclose"></a>
<h5>2.11 - What&rsquo;s the proper way to close a TCP socket?</h5>

<p>TCP is a bidirectional protocol. Think about it like a conversation
between two people. It&rsquo;s rude for one person to simply stop
talking and walk away. Proper social protocol requires that the person
who is done talking wait and listen to what the other person has to
say before walking away. One side starts winding down the conversation
&mdash; &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s been nice, but I have to go.&rdquo;
&mdash; then politely waits for the other person to finish and agree
to finish. (&ldquo;Yes, okay, I&rsquo;ll see you later.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>TCP connections with Winsock are designed to work the same way:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>One side finishes sending data. It tells this to the stack
  by calling <code>shutdown()</code> with the <i>how</i> parameter set to
  <code>SD_SEND</code>.</p></li>

  <li><p>Both sides continue to call <code>recv()</code>. The side that
  closed its sending half of the connection must because the remote
  peer probably isn&rsquo;t done sending yet. The peer that is still
  sending must continue calling <code>recv()</code> because it will get 0 when
  the remote peer calls <code>shutdown()</code> with <code>SD_SEND</code>.
  If you are using asynchronous sockets or event objects, you will
  get an <code>FD_CLOSE</code> when this happens, too. In programs
  that use <code>select()</code>, you simply get a signaled socket in
  the <code>readfds</code>, which tells you to call <code>recv()</code>,
  whereupon you get the 0 return value. Beware that both sides still
  have to be prepared to receive a -1 return from <code>recv()</code>,
  indicating an error.</p></li>

  <li><p>Both sides call <code>closesocket()</code> only when they are
  convinced the conversation is over, either because they have stopped
  sending and they got 0 from <code>recv()</code>, or they got a connection
  error.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Not following this graceful shutdown protocol can cause data loss.</p>

<p>Nonblocking or asynchronous sockets complicate this. You can either
build &ldquo;finish sending/receiving&rdquo; logic into your normal
I/O loop, or you can temporarily put the socket in blocking mode and
do the last bits of I/O that way. The proper choice depends on your
program&rsquo;s architecture and requirements.</p>


<a name="hownotclose"></a>
<h5>2.12 - Is it possible to close the connection &ldquo;abnormally&rdquo;?</h5>

<p>Sure, but it&rsquo;s an evil thing to do. <tt><b>:)</b></tt></p>

<p>The simplest way is to call <code>shutdown()</code> with the
<code>how</code> parameter set to <code>SD_BOTH</code> (&ldquo;both
directions&rdquo;), optionally followed by a <code>closesocket()</code>
call. Another method is to set the <code>SO_LINGER</code>
flag to 0 with the <code>setsockopt()</code> call before you call
<code>closesocket()</code>. This causes a TCP connection reset. (That is,
a TCP packet goes out with the <code>RST</code> flag set, forcing
the remote stack to drop the connection immediately.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slamming the connection shut&rdquo; is only justifiable in
a very small number of cases. You must have fairly deep knowledge
of the way TCP works before you can properly decide to use this
technique. Generally, the perceived need to slam the connection
shut comes from a broken program, either yours or the remote peer. I
recommend that you try to fix the broken program so you don&rsquo;t
have to resort to such a questionable technique.</p>


<a name="normalclose"></a>
<h5>2.13 - How do I detect when my TCP connection is closed?</h5>

<p>All of the I/O strategies discussed in the
<a href="./articles/io-strategies.html">I/O strategies article</a> have some way of
indicating that the connection is closed.</p>

<p>First, keep in mind that TCP is a full-duplex network protocol.
That means that you can close the connection half-way and still send
data on the other half. An example of this is the old HTTP 1.0 web
protocol. The browser sends a short request to the web server, then
closes its half of the connection. The web server then sends back
the requested data on the other half of the connection, and closes
its sending side, which terminates the TCP session. (HTTP 1.1 is more
complex than this, but at the end, the same basic thing happens.)</p>

<p>Normal TCP programs only close the sending half, which the remote
peer perceives as the receiving half. So, what you normally want to
detect is whether the remote peer closed its sending half, meaning
you won&rsquo;t be receiving data from them any more.</p>

<p>With asynchronous sockets, Winsock sends you an
<code>FD_CLOSE</code> message when the connection drops. Event
objects are similar: the system signals the event object with an
<code>FD_CLOSE</code> notification.</p>

<p>With blocking and non-blocking sockets, you probably have a
loop that calls <code>recv()</code> on that socket. <code>recv()</code> returns
0 when the remote peer closes the connection. As you would expect,
if you are using <code>select()</code>, the SOCKET descriptor in the
<code>read_fds</code> parameter gets set when the connection drops. As
normal, you&rsquo;ll call <code>recv()</code> and see the 0 return value.</p>

<p>As you might have guessed from the discussion above, it is also
possible to close the <i>receiving</i> half of the connection. If
the remote peer then tries to send you data, the stack will drop that
data on the floor and send a TCP RST to the remote peer.</p>

<p>See <a href="#abnormalclose">below</a> for information on handling
abnormal disconnects.</p>

<a name="abnormalclose"></a>
<h5>2.14 - How do I detect an abnormal network disconnect?</h5>

<p>The <a href="#normalclose">previous question</a> deals with
detecting when a protocol connection is dropped normally, but what if
you want to detect other problems, like unplugged network cables or
crashed workstations? In these cases, the failure prevents notifying
the remote peer that something is wrong. My feeling is that this is
usually a feature, because the broken component might get fixed before
anyone notices, so why demand that the connection be reestablished?</p>

<p>If you have a situation where you must be able to detect all
network failures, you have two options:</p>

<p>The first option is to give the protocol a command/response
structure: one host sends a command and expects a prompt response
from the other host when the command is received or acted upon. If
the response does not arrive, the connection is assumed to be dead,
or at least faulty.</p>

<p>The second option is to add an &ldquo;echo&rdquo; function to
your protocol, where one host (usually the client) is expected to
periodically send out an &ldquo;are you still there?&rdquo; packet to
the other host, which it must promptly acknowledge. If the echo-sending
host doesn&rsquo;t receive its response or the receiving host fails
to see an echo request for a certain period of time, the program can
assume that the connection is bad or the remote host has gone down.</p>

<p>If you choose the &ldquo;echo&rdquo; alternative, avoid the
temptation to use the ICMP &ldquo;ping&rdquo; facility for this. If you
did it this way, you would have to send pings from both sides, because
Microsoft stacks won&rsquo;t let you see the other side&rsquo;s echo
requests, only responses to your own echo requests. Another problem
with ping is that it&rsquo;s outside your protocol, so it won&rsquo;t
detect a failed TCP connection if the hardware connection remains
viable. A final problem with the ping technique is that ICMP is an
unreliable protocol: does it make a whole lot of sense to use an
unreliable protocol to add an assurance of reliability to another
protocol?</p>

<p>If you can restrict your program to Windows 2000 and its direct
descendants, one option you might consider is TCP keepalives. This is
a way to tell the stack to send a packet out over the connection at
specific intervals whether there&rsquo;s real data to send or not. If
the remote host is up, it will send back a similar reply packet. If
the TCP connection is no longer valid (e.g. the remote host has
rebooted since the last keepalive), the remote host will send back
a reset packet, killing the local host&rsquo;s connection. If the
remote host is down, the local host&rsquo;s TCP stack will time out
waiting for the reply and kill the connection. The main problem with
keepalives is that these packets are entirely wasteful: they carry
no useful data. At least with the command/response option, you have
the possibility that every packet carries meaning.</p>

<p>Note that different types of networks handle physical disconnection
differently. Ethernet, for example, establishes no link-level
connection, so if you unplug the network cable, a remote host
can&rsquo;t tell that its peer is physically unable to communicate. By
contrast, a dropped PPP link causes a detectable failure at the link
layer, which propagates up to the Winsock layer for your program
to detect.</p>

<a name="timeout"></a>
<h5>2.15 - How can I change the timeout for a Winsock function?</h5>

<p>Some of the blocking Winsock functions (e.g. <code>connect()</code>) have
a timeout embedded into them. The theory behind this is that only
the stack has all the information necessary to set a proper timeout.
Yet, some people find that the value the stack uses is too long for
their application; it can be a minute or longer.</p>

<p>You can adjust the <code>send()</code> and <code>recv()</code> timeouts
with the <code>SO_SNDTIMEO</code> and <code>SO_RCVTIMEO</code>
<code>setsockopt()</code> options. .</p>

<p>For other Winsock functions, the best solution is to avoid blocking
sockets altogether. All of the non-blocking socket methods provide
ways for you to build custom timeouts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><b>Non-blocking sockets with <code>select()</code></b> &ndash; The
  fifth parameter to the <code>select()</code> function is a timeout value.

  <li><p><b>Asynchronous sockets</b> &ndash; Use the Windows API
  <code>SetTimer()</code>.</p></li>

  <li><p><b>Event objects</b> &ndash; <code>WSAWaitForMultipleEvents()</code>
  has a timeout parameter.</p></li>

  <li><p><b>Waitable Timers</b> &ndash; Call
  <code>CreateWaitableTimers()</code> to make a waitable timer, which you
  can then pass to a function like <code>WSAEventSelect()</code> along with
  your sockets: if none of the sockets is signalled before the timer
  goes off, the blocking function will return anyway.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that with asynchronous and non-blocking sockets, you may be
able to avoid handling timeouts altogether. Your program continues
working even while Winsock is busy. So, you can leave it up to the
user to cancel an operation that&rsquo;s taking too long, or just
let Winsock&rsquo;s natural timeout expire rather than taking over
this functionality in your code.</p>


<a name="peeking"></a>
<h5>2.16 - What is peeking (MSG_PEEK), and why is it bad?</h5>

<p>Peeking is looking ahead in the TCP data stream: when you use
the MSG_PEEK flag with <code>recv()</code>, it returns bytes from the
stack&rsquo;s buffer without removing these from the buffer. (You
can also do a form of peeking with the <code>ioctlsocket()</code> option
FIONREAD.)</p>

<p>Peeking is essentially never necessary: you can always read data
into your own buffers and process it there. This is good, because
peeking often causes problems. Indeed, it&rsquo;s so problematic
it&rsquo;s earned <a href="./articles/lame-list.html#item12">a place on the
Lame List</a> and in Microsoft&rsquo;s Knowledge Base: see article
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/192599">KB192599</a> for specific info on the problems peeking causes
with their Winsock stack.</p>

<a name="oobdata"></a>
<h5>2.17 - What is out-of-band data (MSG_OOB), and why is it bad?</h5>

<p>Out-of-band (OOB) data is like a second data channel. The intent is
to use the regular TCP data stream for most data and the OOB stream
for &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; messages. The telnet protocol uses this
for &ldquo;interrupt&rdquo; keystrokes like Ctrl-C, so that they
don&rsquo;t have to wait on the remote peer to handle regular TCP data
before the interrupt occurs. You can send OOB data by passing the
<code>MSG_OOB</code> flag to <code>send()</code> and receive it by passing
<code>MSG_OOB</code> to <code>recv()</code>. You can also get OOB data by
setting the <code>SO_OOBINLINE</code> flag with <code>setsockopt()</code>.</p>

<p>OOB data is a useful concept, but unfortunately there are two
conflicing interpretations of how OOB data should be handled at the
stack level: the original description of OOB in the TCP protocol
specification (<a href="../rfcs/official.html#rfc793">RFC 793</a>)
was superceded by the &ldquo;host requirements&rdquo; spec (<a
href="../rfcs/official.html#rfc1122">RFC 1122</a>), but there are
still many machines with RFC 793 OOB implementations. Section 3.5.2
in the Winsock 2.2.2 spec provides the gory details on why RFC 793
vs. RFC 1122 is a problem.</p>

<p>OOB also isn&rsquo;t a fully functional second data channel:
it&rsquo;s rather limited, even between two machines that agree on
what OOB means.</p>

<p>So, never use OOB except when implementing legacy protocols like
telnet which demand it. You can get reliable OOB-like behavior by
simply using two data connections: one for normal data, and the second
for emergency data.</p>

<a name="srflags"></a>
<h5>2.18 - If MSG_PEEK and MSG_OOB are bad, what do I pass for <code>send()</code> and <code>recv()</code>&rsquo;s flags parameter?</h5>

<p>It&rsquo;s perfectly valid to pass 0 for <code>send()</code> and
<code>recv()</code>&rsquo;s flags parameter.</p>
