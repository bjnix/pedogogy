<h5>0.1 - The Original Introduction</h5>

<p>This FAQ was derived from the Winsock FAQ by Mark Towfiq. That
FAQ&rsquo;s introduction:</p>

<p class=inset><i>This FAQ has been put together by Mark Towfiq,
with much-appreciated assistance from Jay Allard, Bruce Backman,
Paul Brooks, Martin Hall, Simon Hewison, Mike Morse, Bob Quinn,
Ed Schwalenberg, Bill Tang, Dave Treadwell, and Fred Whiteside.</i></p>

<a name="aboutme"></a>
<h5>0.2 - About the Maintainer</h5>

<p>This FAQ&rsquo;s current maintainer is <a href="/email/">Warren
Young</a>, who has been maintaining and extending this FAQ
<a href="./history.html">since 1997</a>. He wrote his first networked
program on DOS in 1993, and currently writes mostly for Linux and
OS X.</p>

<a name="askingquestions"></a>
<h5>0.5 - Where can I ask questions not already in the FAQ?</h5>

<p>These days, the best place I know of to ask Winsock questions is
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>. I monitor the
<tt>winsock</tt> tag with my RSS feed reader, so I may even answer
your question. If not, you will likely get a good, rapid answer from
someone else.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/">MSDN</a> <a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/">Library</a> contains
reference documentation, tutorials, and even entire books covering
all of Microsoft&rsquo;s APIs, including Winsock. In recent years,
they&rsquo;ve made it public and web-searchable, so there&rsquo;s
no excuse not to take advantage of it. It&rsquo;s a huge library of
good stuff.</p>

<p>In the old days, the best place to ask was on mailing lists and
Usenet newsgroups that are now dead. Much of what we discussed back
then is still useful. You may be able to dig up information from such
sources via <a href="http://groups.google.com/">Google Groups</a>. If
that doesn&rsquo;t turn up anything useful, try your web search
engine of choice. You might find something in a web archive of one
of the old mail lists. Search engines also turn up newer information
on sites like Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>I ignore most questions sent to me via email, because it goes
totally against the idea of a FAQ. If I reply with the answer,
only one person benefits. If I put the same amount of effort into
adding that info to the FAQ, everyone who reads the FAQ benefits. If
I haven&rsquo;t yet decided to answer your question in the FAQ,
it&rsquo;s probably a rare enough or complex enough question that
asking me to answer it amounts to asking for free, private consulting
services. My generosity does not extend that far.</p>


<a name="mailing-list"></a>
<h5>0.6 - Is there a mailing list for FAQ updates?</h5>

<p>No, not at this time.</p>

<a name="versions"></a>
<h5>0.7 - What Windows and Winsock versions does the FAQ cover?</h5>

<p>This FAQ was started back in the days of Windows 3.1 and Winsock
1.1. It thus used to have a lot of legacy baggage that was just noise
to most programmers today.</p>

<p>In late 2009, I decided it was high time that I refocused the
FAQ on modern Windows, which I&rsquo;ve defined as Windows NT 4.0
SP4 and its direct discendants: Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows
Server 200<i>x</i>, Windows Vista, and Windows 7. Any time I refer
to &ldquo;modern&rdquo; Windows in the FAQ, these are the operating
systems I mean.</p>

<p>Why target NT 4.0 SP4 specifically? This
was the first version of Windows that was both not <a
href="http://oreilly.com/centers/windows/brochure/isnot.html">DOS-based</a>
and that included the current version of Winsock, v2.2.2. (Most people
just say &ldquo;Winsock 2.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Winsock 2 also came with Windows 98, and was available as an <a
href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/182108">add-on</a> for Windows
95, though both of these do have some differences and limitations
compared to NT 4 SP4. Legacy information for these and older systems is
now in a <a href="./articles/history.html">separate history article</a>, which
also answers the question of why the current version of the Winsock
spec is over 12 years old. It includes much of historical interest.</p>

<p>Most of the FAQ still applies to Winsock 1.1 and BSD
Sockets, simply because these are largely backwards-compatible
APIs. I advise on how to choose among these alternatives in <a
href="newbie.html#targetapi">this FAQ item</a>. In addition, the
FAQ has one article covering <a href="./articles/othersys.html">Winsock
alternatives</a> for other operating systems.</p>

<p>The FAQ doesn&rsquo;t cover Windows CE (or Pocket PC, or Windows
Mobile, or Windows Phone, or whatever they&rsquo;re calling the
damn thing this year) in any depth. The last time I looked into
it, when WinCE 4 was current, its Winsock implementation was rather
crippled. The FAQ does therefore include some workarounds for missing
features. I don&rsquo;t know if newer versions of the OS are closer
to their desktop cousins in this regard.</p>

<p>This FAQ assumes you are using development tools that
are new enough to include Winsock support. It hasn&rsquo;t
been necessary to download a separate Winsock SDK for many
years. If you truly are using tools so old they don&rsquo;t
have things like <tt>winsock.h</tt>, you can try installing the <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdk-full.htm">Windows
Platform SDK</a>. It includes Microsoft&rsquo;s Winsock SDK,
and thus works best with Visual C++. If possible, you should
simply upgrade your development tools. Microsoft has been
giving away perfectly usable versions of their Visual Studio
components for years now. For Winsock programming, you want <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/Express/VC/">Visual C++ Express</a>.
Microsoft has said they&rsquo;re going to keep offering this,
so don&rsquo;t worry that it might go away some day. It might,
but I don&rsquo;t think it will go away any sooner than its direct
competition, things like <a href="http://mingw.org">MinGW</a> and
<a href="http://cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of, the FAQ&rsquo;s code is supposed to build
with the MinGW and Cygwin versions of GCC. It&rsquo;s tested
primarily with modern versions of Visual C++, but we do try for
compatibility. You&rsquo;ll have to work out the build commands on
your own, though.</p>

<a name="langbias"></a>
<h5>0.8 - Programming Language Bias</h5>

<p>This FAQ is biased towards C, with some C++ as well. There are a
number of other reasons I don&rsquo;t use some other language:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>C is the <i>lingua franca</i> of Windows programming. Other
  languages may be more popular for writing Windows programs, but at
  bottom, Windows is based on C.</p></li>

  <li><p>The Winsock API derives from the C-centric Unix world&rsquo;s
  BSD Sockets API.</p></li>

  <li><p>Every other language I&rsquo;m aware of that&rsquo;s
  commonly used on Windows already has some language-specific way to
  do network programming. You no longer have to write to the Winsock
  API in these languages, as you did in the bad old days.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Problems that only affect, say, Visual Basic, are not covered
in the FAQ. The FAQ&rsquo;s <a href="./resources/index.html">Resources</a>
section and the FAQ item <a href="./newbie.html#langcompat">Can I use
Winsock with { My Favorite Language }?</a> may be of some use.</p>


<a name="protbias"></a>
<h5>0.9 - Protocol Bias</h5>

<p>This FAQ only covers the TCP/IP transport protocol suite at
this time, simply because I&rsquo;ve never programmed for any other
transport. Winsock supports <a href="./general.html#transport">many other
transports</a>, but I can&rsquo;t even help you to find info about
them, other than pointing you to <a href="#askingquestions">places
to ask questions</a>.</p>

<a name="acknowledgements"></a>
<h5>0.10 - Acknowledgements</h5>

<p>A FAQ is never an isolated thing. It takes many people, from patient
gurus willing to share their knowledge, down to the masses of ignorant
newbies posting the same damn questions yet again. Without gurus,
there can be no accuracy. Without newbies, there&rsquo;s no grist for
the mill. And without everyone from newbies on up, there&rsquo;s no
point in having a FAQ.</p>

<p>My first contribution, as mentioned above, is Mark Towfiq&rsquo;s
original FAQ. Although not much remains of the original material, it
did provide this FAQ&rsquo;s initial core. I might not have decided to
create a FAQ in the first place &mdash; it probably took an existing,
langushing FAQ to prod me.</p>

<p>Bob Quinn (of <a href="reviews/wsnp.html">Windows Sockets Network
Programming</a> fame) keeps me accurate and has provided inspiration
for a number of the FAQ&rsquo;s current questions.</p>

<p>Philippe Jounin has provided invaluable input by way of a different
perspective. That added perspective has corrected several bits of
tunnel vision in this FAQ.</p>

<p>Alun Jones has repeatedly pointed out my various
failings. (I&rsquo;m grateful for this, really I am.) In one way or
another, those corrections improve the quality of the information in
this FAQ.</p>

<p>As of Spring of 2000, the FAQ began including articles, code and
FAQ items from various Winsockers around the globe. I thank these
people for letting me kipe their good works. (These items are marked
with the original author&rsquo;s name.)</p>

<p>And of course, there are dozens of others who have sent me email
with snippets, corrections, suggestions, pointers and atta-boys. Thanks
to you all.</p>
