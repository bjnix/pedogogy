<h5>4.1 - Does Winsock support raw sockets?</h5>

<p>Yes, with limitations.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<pre>
         SOCKET sd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_ICMP);
</pre>

<p>This says we want a raw IP-based socket (<code>AF_INET</code>)
that uses ICMP&rsquo;s registered IP protocol number,
1, which the Winsock headers have helpfully provided as
the <code>IPPROTO_ICMP</code> constant. The Winsock headers
define several more <code>IPPROTO_*</code> constants, but <a
href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/">many
more</a> IP-based protocols exist. You can pass any value
from that list, which allows your program to implement
that protocol. (There are restrictions, noted below.)
For instance, you could pass 132 if you wanted to implement <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_Control_Transmission_Protocol">SCTP</a>
in user space. You could even use this feature to implement some new
IP-based protocol. As I write this, protocol numbers 141-252 are still
unassigned; you should use 253 or 254 for testing, as they have been
reserved for that purpose.</p>

<p>You should only use raw sockets if that is the only way to do what
you want. There are several problems with raw sockets:</p>

<ol>
    <li><p>Your program needs administrator rights on the machine to
    use raw sockets.</p></li>

    <li><p>Raw sockets are much slower than an in-kernel protocol
    driver using the stack&rsquo;s Transport Data Interface. The
    TDI mechanism is documented and works hand-in-hand with Winsock,
    just from the other side of the kernel/user space barrier.</p>

    <p>One of the biggest arguments against writing a driver is that
    you have to have admin rights to install it, but since that applies
    to raw sockets anyway, it&rsquo;s actually an anti-argument:
    a TDI protocol driver lets even unprivileged users use it,
    through Winsock. (Above, I gave the example of SCTP, which you
    could implement for fun in user space, but for production use,
    you&rsquo;d probably want to buy one of the existing kernel
    drivers.)</p></li>

    <li><p>There are some things raw sockets simply cannot do, either
    because Microsoft hasn&rsquo;t added the feature to Windows yet,
    or because they&rsquo;ve intentionally prevented it, such as for
    security reasons.</p></li>

    <li><p>While you <i>can</i> use it to <a href="#pktcapture">capture
    packets</a>, it&rsquo;s rather buggy. See that FAQ item for the
    problems and the recommended alternative.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Windows NT 4 only supports raw ICMP and raw IGMP. Primarily, this is
to allow programs to <a href="./examples/rawping.html">send &ldquo;ping&rdquo;
packets</a> in a standard way. I don&rsquo;t see the point of raw
IGMP, since Winsock provides APIs for multicast group management,
which should suffice.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 greatly expanded raw sockets support relative to NT
4. It shares this level of capability with</p>

<ul>
    <li>Windows XP (original release)</li>
    <li>Windows XP SP1</li>
    <li>Windows Server 2003</li>
    <li>Windows Server 2008 (original release)</li>
</ul>

<p>Microsoft added some restrictions on raw sockets in the personal
versions of Windows starting with XP SP2, and in the server
versions starting with Windows Server 2008 R2. The first two exist
to block certain kinds of malware. First, raw TCP is now completely
disallowed. Less severe, with raw UDP, you can no longer spoof the
source address. A third restriction, which just seems weird to me, is
that you are no longer allowed to bind a raw socket to a particular
network interface. That&rsquo;s almost like an anti-restriction,
since it means raw sockets always receive incoming packets with the
requested IP protocol number from all interfaces.</p>

<p>Most of the time with raw sockets, you will simply build on top
of the IP layer, letting the stack provide the IP header and set
all its fields. If you need to change one or more of these fields,
first look in the documentation for <code>setsockopt()</code>. You may find
that there is an option for that already, such as <code>IP_TTL</code>
to set the TTL field&rsquo;s default value. If no such option exists
and you&rsquo;re running a <a href="./intro.html#versions">modern</a>
version of Windows newer than Windows NT 4, you may be able to get the
behavior you want with the <code>IP_HDRINCL</code> socket option. This
tells the stack that data you pass on your raw socket will include
the IP header as well as that of the next protocol level up.</p>

<a name="pktcapture"></a>
<h5>4.2 - How can I capture packets on a LAN with Winsock?</h5>

<p>You can do this on Windows 2000 and later by passing
<code>SIO_RCVALL</code> as the second parameter to <code>WSAIoctl()</code>.</p>

<p>This feature has several problems:</p>

<ol>
    <li><p>It requires administrator privileges.</p></li>

    <li><p>In all versions of Windows from 2000 through the original
    Windows Server 2008 release, this method only lets you see incoming
    packets.  It wasn&rsquo;t until Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows
    7 that this mechanism would also show you packets sent <i>from</i>
    the machine.</p></li>

    <li><p>It&rsquo;s easily broken by things like <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_Offload_Engine">TCP
    Offload Engines</a>. The alternatives recommended below operate
    at a lower level, so they can simply ask the network interface
    to run in &ldquo;promiscuous&rdquo; mode, passing everything
    through without processing. The current <code>SIO_RCVALL</code>
    implementation doesn&rsquo;t do this. To be fair, sometimes there
    is a driver option in the Control Panel that lets you control this,
    but that&rsquo;s a hassle.</p></li>

    <li><p>Most other common desktop operating systems have some way
    to ask the kernel to do some of the filtering for you.  Not so
    with <code>SIO_RCVALL</code>. You want this, because your program is
    probably interested in only some packets, so you have to filter
    out the ones you aren&rsquo;t interested in. At gigabit speeds,
    it can take a surprising amount of CPU power to do this. You might
    not be able to do it fast enough to prevent the kernel from running
    out of buffer space, forcing it to drop packets. Doing at least
    some of the filtering in the kernel can make this practical,
    since it saves a kernel to user space context switch for each
    filtered packet.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A better plan is to bypass Winsock and talk to either the
Transport Data Interface (TDI) layer or to the Network Device
Interface Specification (NDIS) layer. The TDI layer is just above
the system&rsquo;s NDIS (network driver) layer.</p>

<p>You may not need to write this code yourself. The
same packet capture driver used by the Windows version of
<a href="./#Wireshark">Wireshark</a> &mdash; the famous
open source cross-platform <a href="./newbie.html#debugtools">sniffer</a>
&mdash; is also freely available. It is called <a
href="http://www.winpcap.org/">WinPcap</a>. You may remember seeing the
WinPcap installer run if you&rsquo;ve installed Wireshark already.</p>

<p>WinPcap solves all of the problems above. The only tricky bit is
that you have to be an admin to install it, and the feature that lets
non-admins request packet capture services is an install-time option.
If you&rsquo;re an unpriviledged user on a system where the driver
is already installed, it&rsquo;s possible your admin installed it
with this feature disabled.</p>

<p>If you did have to write your own packet capture driver, you
should look into some helper libraries to ease the creation. As of
this writing, I know of <a href="./resources/libraries.html#Komodia">Komodia
TCP/IP Library</a>, <a href="./resources/libraries.html#LibnetNT">LibnetNT</a>
and <a href="./resources/libraries.html#PCAUSA">WinDis32</a>.</p>

<p>PCAUSA &mdash; the makers of WinDis32 &mdash; also has <a
href="http://www.pcausa.com/resources/">several FAQs</a> that talk
about various low-level network stack access methods. These FAQs
also point you to various bits of sample code, most of it from
Microsoft&rsquo;s various DDKs.</p>


<a name="pktheader"></a>
<h5>4.3 - How can I change the contents of a packet?</h5>

<p>If you just need to change a particular field in
an outgoing packet&rsquo;s TCP or IP header, look up
<code>setsockopt()</code>, <code>ioctlsocket()</code> and <code>WSAIoctl()</code>
in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/">MSDN</a> <a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/">Library</a>. You might find
that there is an option specifically for that. For instance, you can
change the IP header&rsquo;s TTL field by setting the <code>IP_TTL</code>
socket option.</p>

<p>If those mechanisms don&rsquo;t expose control of the field you
need to change, you may be able to build your own packet headers with
<a href="#rawsocket">raw sockets</a>. Beware that newer versions
of Windows have added restrictions that prevent some types of
modifications, usually for security reasons.</p>

<p>If you need more complete control, you will have to dig below the
Winsock API level.</p>

<p>One option is to write a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layered_service_provider">Layered
Service Provider</a>. An LSP is able to inject itself into the
stack, so it can inspect and change data at will. Web filtering
programs typically do their thing with an LSP, for instance. LSPs
are a feature of Winsock, but this FAQ concerns itself only with
the Winsock API. LSPs talk to the <i>other</i> Winsock interface,
the Service Provider Interface (SPI). The best Winsock SPI reference
I know of is the MSDN Library.</p>

<p>Another option is to write a driver that talks to the Transport
Data Interface (TDI) layer or to the Network Driver Interface
Specification (NDIS) layer. Further information is available in <a
href="http://www.pcausa.com/resources/">PCAUSA&rsquo;s FAQs</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, don&rsquo;t be too quick to rule out the option of
building your application on a platform that gives you better access
to low-level packet details. Most Unix flavors (including Linux) offer
powerful mechanisms for low-level network I/O. This is one reason more
network appliances are built on Linux or BSD Unix than on Windows. For
information on raw network programming on such platforms, see Thamer
Al-Herbish&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ntua.gr/rin/rawfaq.html">Raw
IP Networking FAQ</a>.</p>


<a name="ping"></a>
<h5>4.4 - How can I &ldquo;ping&rdquo; another machine?</h5>

<p>The &ldquo;official&rdquo; method uses the <code>IPPROTO_ICMP</code>
<a href="#rawsocket">raw socket</a> type, supported by every
<a href="./intro.html#versions">modern</a> version of Windows,
and several older ones as well. <a href="./examples/rawping.html">[C++
example]</a></p>

<p>The other method uses ICMP.DLL, an even older part of Windows that
Microsoft <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/170591">claims</a>
they&rsquo;re going to remove some day. They&rsquo;ve been saying
that since at least the Windows XP days, and it&rsquo;s still in
Windows 7. They doubtless keep it around because, unlike the raw
sockets method, it lets you send ping packets without administrator
privileges. The raw sockets method does have one advantage over the
ICMP.DLL method: because it requires that you build the raw ICMP
packet from scratch, you have complete control over its contents. The
ICMP.DLL is simpler, but less powerful.  <a href="./examples/dllping.html">[C++
example]</a></p>

<p>Many programs misuse ping. Naturally it has good uses,
but it&rsquo;s a sign of a broken program or protocol if you
find yourself resorting to regular use of ping packets. The
most common case of ping abuse is when the program needs to
<a href="./newbie.html#abnormalclose">detect dropped connections</a>. See
that FAQ item for better solutions to this problem.</p>


<a name="dllsockets"></a>
<h5>4.5 - Is it possible to create sockets that map to a DLL rather than an application?</h5>

<p>Under Windows, a DLL&rsquo;s data is actually owned by the
application that loads the DLL. If you need the DLL to own a single
socket no matter how many processes load the DLL, you need to
create a &ldquo;helper process&rdquo; which will perform all Winsock
operations on behalf of the DLL. Naturally you&rsquo;ll need some
kind of interprocess communication channel between the DLL and the
helper process.</p>

<p>Note that this issue only matters if you&rsquo;re using a DLL to let
multiple processes share a socket. If you only have one process using
the DLL, or if it&rsquo;s okay for each process to remain ignorant
of the other processes using the DLL, this issue won&rsquo;t matter
to you.</p>


<a name="snmp"></a>
<h5>4.6 - How can I get access to the {route, ARP, interface, etc.} table?</h5>

<p>Use Windows&rsquo; <a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa379100.aspx">SNMP API</a>.
It allows you to access many &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; parts of the Windows
networking subsystem, including the network interface list, the route
and ARP tables, the list of connected network sockets, your Ethernet
cards&rsquo; hardware addresses, etc.</p>

<p><a href="./examples/getmac-snmp.html">One</a> of the FAQ&rsquo;s
<a href="./examples/index.html">examples</a> uses this API.</a>

<a name="macaddr"></a>
<h5>4.7 - How do I get the MAC (a.k.a. hardware) address of the local Ethernet adapter?</h5>

<p>This FAQ has example code for two hackish methods and one complex
but reliable method.</p>

<p>The <a href="./examples/getmac-netbios.html">first method</a> involves asking
the NetBIOS API for the adapter addresses. This method will fail on
systems where NetBIOS isn&rsquo;t present, and it sometimes gives
bogus answers.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="./examples/getmac-rpc.html">second method</a> that depends
on a property of the RPC/OLE API. This property is documented but not
guaranteed to do what we want, and in fact it fails in a number of
situations. (Details in the example program&rsquo;s commentary.) As
a result, I have to recommend that you give this method a miss.</p>

<p>The <a href="./examples/getmac-snmp.html">third method</a> uses the
sparsely-documented SNMP API to get MAC addresses. This method seems
to work all the time, but it&rsquo;s far more complex than the other
two methods.</p>

<p>There is one other method for which I don&rsquo;t yet
have an example: the IP Helper API has a function called
<code>GetIfTable()</code> which returns a table containing MAC addresses,
among many other tasty bits of info. This method works on all
<a href="./intro.html#versions">modern</a> versions of Windows, and on a
few older ones as well. Reportedly, you have to use <code>LoadLibrary()</code>
to dig this function out of <tt>iphlpapi.dll</tt>, as it isn&rsquo;t
exposed for direct linking. It&rsquo;s just as well, since implicitly
linking to <tt>iphlpapi.dll</tt> lets your program fail gracefully
when run on versions of Windows without this function.</p>

<p>There are some <a
href="http://www.pcausa.com/resources/ndisfaq.htm#FindMACAddress">lower-level
methods</a> in PCAUSA&rsquo;s NDIS FAQ that may also be helpful
to you.</p>


<a name="maxsockets"></a>
<h5>4.8 - How many simultaneous sockets can I have open?</h5>

<p>There is no fixed connection or socket limit on any
<a href="./intro.html#versions">modern</a> version of Windows. The limit
depends on the <a href="./articles/io-strategies.html">I/O strategy</a> you use,
the amount of memory in the system, and your program&rsquo;s network
usage pattern:</p>

<p class=inset><b>The I/O Strategy Factor:</b> As the above-linked
article points out, there are many possible I/O strategies with
Winsock. This is because they have different strengths and weaknesses,
one of which is how well the strategy fares in high connection count
situations. If you have to get into the thousands of connections,
you want to use overlapped I/O, the only strategy that reliably allows
you to achieve such high connection counts. Other strategies &mdash;
asynchronous notification, <code>select()</code>, thread-per-socket... &mdash;
will hit some other performance wall before the network stack
itself starts running out of resources. Some take too much CPU,
others require lots of context switches, others use inefficient
notification mechanisms.</p>

<p class=inset><b>The Memory Factor:</b> According to Microsoft, all
modern versions of Windows allocate sockets out of the non-paged memory
pool. (That is, memory that cannot be swapped to the page file by the
virtual memory subsystem.) The size of this pool is necessarily fixed,
and is dependent on the amount of physical memory in the system. On
Intel x86 machines, the non-paged memory pool stops growing at 1/8
the size of physical memory, with a hard maximum of 128 megabytes for
Windows NT 4.0, and 256 megabytes for Windows 2000. You thus hit the
maxium with 1 or 2&nbsp;GB of RAM, respectively. (I do not have any
information on whether these limits have increased in newer versions
of Windows, or if something different happens on 64-bit CPUs. If you
do, <a href="/email/">email me</a>.)</p>

<p class=inset><b>The &ldquo;Busy-ness&rdquo; Factor:</b> The amount
of data associated with each socket varies depending on how that
socket&rsquo;s used, but the minimum size is around 2 KB. Overlapped
I/O buffers also eat into the non-paged pool, in blocks of 4 KB. (4 KB
is the x86 memory management unit&rsquo;s page size.) Thus a simplistic
application that&rsquo;s regularly sending and receiving on a socket
will tie up at least 10 KB of non-pageable memory. Assuming that
simple case of 10 KB of data per connection, the theoretical maximum
number of sockets on NT 4.0 is about 12,800, and on Win2K 25,600.</p>

<p>I have seen reports of a 64 MB Windows NT 4.0 machine hitting
the wall at 1,500 connections, a 128 MB machine at around 4,000
connections, and a 192 MB machine maxing out at 4,700 connections. It
would appear that on these machines, each connection is using between
4 KB and 6 KB. The discrepancy between these numbers and the 10 KB
number above is probably due to the fact that in these servers, not
all connections were sending and receiving all the time. The idle
connections will only be using about 2 KB each.</p>

<p>So, adjusting our &ldquo;average&rdquo; size down to 6 KB per
socket, NT 4.0 could handle about 22,000 sockets and Win2K about 44,000
sockets. The largest value I&rsquo;ve seen reported is 16,000 sockets
on Windows NT 4.0. This lower actual value is probably partially
due to the fact that the entire non-paged memory pool isn&rsquo;t
available to a single program. Other running programs (such as core
OS services) will be competing with yours for space in the non-paged
memory pool.</p>


<a name="64sockets"></a>
<h5>4.9 - What are the &ldquo;64 sockets&rdquo; limitations?</h5>

<p>There are two 64-socket limitations:</p>

<p>The Windows event mechanism (e.g. <code>WaitForMultipleObjects()</code>)
can only wait on 64 event objects at a time. Winsock 2 provides the
<code>WSAEventSelect()</code> function which lets you use Windows&rsquo;
event mechanism to wait for events on sockets. Because it uses
Windows&rsquo; event mechanism, you can only wait for events on 64
sockets at a time. If you want to wait on more than 64 Winsock event
objects at a time, you need to use multiple threads, each waiting on
no more than 64 of the sockets.</p>

<p>The <code>select()</code> function is also limited in certain situations
to waiting on 64 sockets at a time. The <code>FD_SETSIZE</code>
constant defined in the Winsock header determines the size of the
<code>fd_set</code> structures you pass to <code>select()</code>. The default
value is 64, but if you define this constant to a different value
before including the Winsock header, it accepts that value instead:</p>

<pre>
        #define FD_SETSIZE 1024
        #include &lt;wsock32.h&gt;
</pre>

<p>The problem is that modern network stacks are complex, with
many parts coming from various sources, including third parties via
things like Layered Service Providers. When you change this constant,
you&rsquo;re depending on all these components to play by the new
rules. They&rsquo;re supposed to, but not all do. The typical symptom
is that they ignore sockets beyond the 64th in larger <code>fd_set</code>
structures. You can get around this limitation with threads, just as
in the event object case.</p>


<a name="forceif"></a>
<h5>4.10 - How do I make Winsock use a specific network interface?</h5>

<p>Before I answer the stated question, keep in mind that the
routing layer of the stack exists to handle this for you. If your
setup isn&rsquo;t working the way you want, maybe you just need to
change the routing tables. (This is done with the <code>route</code>
and <code>netstat</code> command-line programs.)</p>

<p>There are two common reasons you might want to force the stack to
use a particular network interface. The first is when you only want
your server program to handle incoming connections on a particular
interface. For example, perhaps one of the interfaces on your machine
is an Ethernet card connected to a private LAN and the other is a USB
DSL modem connected to the big bad Internet. In such a case, listening
only on the trusted network is safer, if you can get away with it. The
other reason is that you have two or more possible outgoing routes,
and you want your client program to connect using a particular one
without the routing layer getting in the way.</p>

<p>You can do both of these things with the <code>bind()</code>
function. Using one of the &ldquo;get my IP addresses&rdquo;
<a href="./examples/index.html">examples</a>, you can present your user with
a list of possible addresses. Then they can pick the appropriate
address to use, which your program will use in the <code>bind()</code>
call. Obviously, this is only feasible for programs intended for
advanced users.</p>

<p><a href="./intro.html#versions">Modern</a> versions of Windows let
you give a network interface multiple IP addresses in the Network
control panel. Get into the Advanced settings, where the other TCP/IP
settings are, and you will find a place where you can enter multiple
IP addresses for that single interface. The last time I tried this,
the workstation and home class versions of Windows limited you to 5
addresses here, with the server class versions being unlimited.</p>

<p class="aside"><b>Aside:</b> One of the ways Internet hosting
companies provide virtual shared hosting involves this technique of
adding multiple IP aliases for a single network interface.  Each site
hosted on that server is assigned one of these IP addresses, and
the web server listens on each of them individually. This lets it
detect which IP address an incoming connection came in on, and thus
which site&rsquo;s web pages it should serve up. A single physical
server thus appears, to outside clients, to be many servers. There
are other varieties of virtual hosting, but diving deeper would take
us off the topic of this FAQ item.</p>

<a name="waitstates"></a>
<h5>4.11 - What do the FIN_WAIT_<i>x</i>, TIME_WAIT, CLOSE_WAIT and other states mean?</h5>

<p>These socket states are dispayed by the <code>netstat</code>
tool. For information on what they mean and what to do about them,
see the FAQ article <a href="./articles/debugging-tcp.html">Debugging TCP/IP</a>.</p>

<a name="tcpbits"></a>
<h5>4.12 - What is the { SYN, ACK, FIN, RST } bit?</h5>

<p>See the FAQ article <a href="./articles/debugging-tcp.html">Debugging TCP/IP</a>.</p>


<a name="clientbind"></a>
<h5>4.13 - Is it a bad idea to <tt>bind()</tt> to a particular port in a client program?</h5>

<p>It&rsquo;s occasionally justifiable, but most of the time
it&rsquo;s a very bad idea. I&rsquo;ve only heard of two good uses
of this feature:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Some protocols demand that the client connection come in from
  a port in a particular range. Some implementations of the Berkeley
  &ldquo;r-commands&rdquo; (e.g.  <code>rlogin</code>, <code>rsh</code>,
  <code>rcp</code>, etc.) do this for security purposes. Because only
  privileged users can bind to a low-numbered port (1-1023) on modern
  operating systems, a connection coming from such a port implies
  that the remote user is a privileged user. This is one of the very
  tiny nods to security in the r-command scheme, in that the server
  program only believes a remote user claiming to be <code>root</code>
  is who they say they are if the connection comes in on a low-numbered
  port. (These protocols are otherwise horribly insecure, and thus
  no longer used on any system that has a clueful sysadmin.) These
  commands achieve this by attempting to bind, one by one, to each
  port in this range until it succeeds. This is a Unix-centric view,
  though it does also apply on <a href="./intro.html#versions">modern</a>
  versions of Windows where normal users aren&rsquo;t running as
  Administrator.</p></li>

  <li><p>The other common example is FTP in its &ldquo;active&rdquo;
  mode: the client binds to a random port and then tells the server to
  connect to that port for the next data transfer. This is justifiable
  because it arguably cleans up the protocol, and the FTP client
  doesn&rsquo;t need to bind to any particular port, it just needs to
  bind to <i>a</i> port. (Incidentally, it does this by binding to port
  0 &mdash; the stack chooses an available port when you do this.) This
  is also justifiable because the FTP client is acting as a server in
  this case, so it makes sense that it has to bind to a port.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that in neither example are we trying to bind to a
<i>particular</i> port. This is good design, for a client. Both
examples have the client being flexible about the ports they bind to,
because by nature client connections are typically transient, while
servers tend to run for long periods of time, often as long as the
physical machine runs.  A long-running process has a better claim on
a particular port than a transient one, since if it fails to acquire
access to that port, the system administrator is far more likely to
figure out the problem. A program that&rsquo;s expected to always
run will fail to start, and it is likely to fail again if you reboot
the server because the conflicting program will grab the same port
again itself. If there&rsquo;s a port conflict in a client, it likely
won&rsquo;t happen every time, and even if it does, it only happens
when the client runs.  It is therefore much trickier to debug.</p>

<p>For another reason it&rsquo;s bad to bind to a particular port
in a client, consider a web browser. They typically create several
connections to download a single web page, one each to fetch all
of the individual pieces of the page: images, applets, sound clips,
etc. Often it has multiple connections open to a single server so the
downloads can proceed in parallel. If a web browser were to bind to
a particular local port, this wouldn&rsquo;t work. They could only
have one connection going at a time, or depending on how it&rsquo;s
done, even just one instance of the web browser prgoram running at
a time.</p>

<p>On top of all that, there&rsquo;s another problem. When you close
a TCP connection, it goes into the <tt>TIME_WAIT</tt> state for a
short period (between 30 and 120 seconds, typically), during which
you cannot reuse that connection&rsquo;s &ldquo;5-tuple:&rdquo;
the combination of {local host, local port, remote host, remote
port, transport protocol}. (This timeout period is a feature
of all correctly-written TCP/IP stacks, and is covered in <a
href="/rfcs/official.html#rfc793">RFC 793</a> and especially <a
href="/rfcs/official.html#rfc1122">RFC 1122</a>.) In practical terms,
this means that if you bind to a specific port all the time, you
cannot connect to the same host using the same remote port until the
<tt>TIME_WAIT</tt> period expires. I have personally seen anomalous
cases where the <tt>TIME_WAIT</tt> period does not occur, but when
this happens, it&rsquo;s a bug in the stack, not something you should
count on.</p>

<h5>4.14 - What is the connection backlog?</h5>

<p>When a connection request comes into a
<a href="./glossary.html#stack">network&nbsp;stack</a>, it first checks to see if
any program is listening on the requested port. If so, the stack
replies to the <a href="./glossary.html#peer">remote&nbsp;peer</a>, completing the
connection. The stack stores the connection information in a queue
called the connection backlog. (When there are connections in the
backlog, the <code>accept()</code> call simply causes the stack to remove
the oldest connection from the connection backlog and return a socket
for it.)</p>

<p>One of the parameters to the <code>listen()</code> call sets the size
of the connection backlog for a particular socket. When the backlog
fills up, the stack begins rejecting connection attempts.</p>

<p>Rejecting connections is a good thing if your program is written to
accept new connections as fast as it reasonably can. If the backlog
fills up despite your program&rsquo;s best efforts, it means your
server has hit its load limit. If the stack were to accept more
connections, your program wouldn&rsquo;t be able to handle them as
well as it should, so the client will think your server is hanging. At
least if the connection is rejected, the client will know the server
is too busy and will try again later.</p>

<p>The proper value for <code>listen()</code>&rsquo;s <code>backlog</code>
parameter depends on how many connections you expect to see in the
time between <code>accept()</code> calls. Let&rsquo;s say you expect an
average of 1000 connections per second, with a burst value of 3000
connections per second. (I picked these values because they&rsquo;re
easy to manipulate, not because they&rsquo;re representative of the
real world!) To handle the burst load with a short connection backlog,
your server&rsquo;s time between <code>accept()</code> calls must be under 0.3
milliseconds. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve measured your time-to-accept
under load, and it&rsquo;s 0.8 milliseconds: fast enough to handle the
normal load, but too slow to handle your burst value. In this case,
you could make <code>backlog</code> relatively large to let the stack
queue up connections under burst conditions. Assuming that these
bursts are short, your program will quickly catch up and clear out
the connection backlog.</p>

<p>The traditional value for <code>listen()</code>&rsquo;s <code>backlog</code>
parameter is 5. This is actually the limit on the home and
workstation class versions of Windows. On Windows Server, the maximum
connection backlog size is 200, unless the dynamic backlog feature
is enabled. (More info on dynamic backlogs below.) Because the stack
will use its maximum backlog value if you pass in a larger value, you
can pass a special constant, <code>SOMAXCONN</code>, to <code>listen()</code>
which tells it to use whatever the platform maximum is, since the
constant&rsquo;s value is 0x7FFFFFFF. There is no standard way to
find out what backlog value the stack chose to use if it overrides
your requested value.</p>

<p>If your program is quick about calling <code>accept()</code>, low backlog
limits are not normally a problem. However, it does mean that concerted
attempts to make lots of connections in a short period of time can
fill the backlog queue. This makes non-Server flavors of Windows
a bad choice for a <a href="./intermediate.html#high-load">high-load
server</a>: either a legitimate load or a <code>SYN</code> flood attack
can overload a server on such a platform. (See below for more on
<code>SYN</code> attacks.)</p>

<p>Beware that large backlogs make <code>SYN</code> flood attacks much
more, shall we say, effective. When Winsock creates the backlog queue,
it starts small and grows as required. Since the backlog queue is
in non-pageable system memory, a <code>SYN</code> flood can cause the
queue to eat a lot of this precious memory resource.</p>

<p>After the first <code>SYN</code> flood attacks in 1996, Microsoft
added a feature to Windows NT 4.0 SP3 called the &ldquo;dynamic
backlog.&rdquo; This feature is normally off for backwards
compatibility, but when you turn it on, the stack can increase or
decrease the size of the connection backlog in response to network
conditions. (It can even increase the backlog beyond the normal maximum
of 200, in order to soak up malicious <code>SYN</code>s.) The Microsoft
Knowledge Base <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/142641">article</a> that describes the feature
also has some good practical discussion about connection backlogs.</p>

<p>You will note that <code>SYN</code> attacks are dangerous for systems
with both very short and very long backlog queues. The point is that a
middle ground is the best course if you expect your server to withstand
<code>SYN</code> attacks. Either use Microsoft&rsquo;s dynamic backlog
feature, or pick a value somewhere in the 20-200 range and tune it
as required.</p>

<p>A program can rely too much on the backlog feature. Consider a
single-threaded blocking server: the design means it can only handle
one connection at a time. However, it can set up a large backlog,
making the stack accept and hold connections until the program gets
around to handling the next one. (See <a href="./examples/basics/basic-server.html">this
example</a> to see the technique at work.) You should not take
advantage of the feature this way unless your connection rate is very
low and the connection times are very short. (Pedagogues excepted.
Everyone else designing such a program should probably use 1, 0, or
even close the listening socket while there is a client connected.)</p>
