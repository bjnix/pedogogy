<p><b>2011.02.21</b><br><p class=inset> Modernized the &ldquo;<a
href="articles/othersys.html">Winsock for Non-Windows Systems</a>&rdquo;
article.</p>

<p><b>2010.03.01</b><br><p class=inset> New navbar icons.</p>

<p><b>2010.02.28</b><br><p class=inset> Finished modernizing the
<a href="./resources/index.html">Winsock Resources</a> section. Lots of stuff there got moved into
the <a href="./articles/history.html">history of Winsock</a> article, and a
fair bit was just removed as irrelevant these days. Merged several
of the pages together, as several of them got pared down to just a
few links each. The new <a href="./resources/other.html">Other Web Pages</a> page holds most of
what was left from this process.</p>

<p><b>2010.02.21</b><br><p class=inset> Moved discussion about what packet
sniffers are out of <a href="newbie.html#debugtools">the FAQ item on
debugging tools</a> into a <a href="./articles/sniffer.html">new article</a>
and greatly expanded the discussion. Added history and a lot more
detail about the limitations of sniffers and workarounds for those
limitations.</p>

<p class=inset>Moved discussion of available debugging tools into
the debugging tools FAQ item, and removed the Resources section
that listed them. The main value of that section was the reviews,
most of which hadn&rsquo;t been updated in a decade, with no prospect
for that changing.  Better to just list them and let the reader make
their own decision.</p>

<p class=inset>Still more URL fixes, stale product removals, etc. in
Resources section.</p>

<p><b>2010.01.20</b><br><p class=inset> Finished modernizing the
<a href="./advanced.html">advanced</a> section of the FAQ.</p>

<p><b>2010.01.18</b><br><p class=inset> Expanded the
<a href="./articles/history.html">history of Winsock</a> article quite a bit.
Divided it up into pure history and Winsock technical detail sections
better, and overall made it clearer and more enlightening.</p>

<p class=inset>Lots of minor tweaks and cleanups.</p>

<p><b>2009.10.29</b><br><p class=inset> Major update to Intro through
Intermediate sections of the FAQ, and half the Advanced section. (More
coming, just published what I have so far.) A few other bits touched
in passing, too. Details:</p>

<p class=inset>I finally made the decision to drop Win16,
Win9<i>x</i>, Windows NT 3.<i>x</i>, and Winsock 1.1 specific
material from the main body of the FAQ. This leaves material
that does cover these things generically, but which only covers
&ldquo;<a href="./intro.html#versions">modern</a>&rdquo; versions of
Windows specifically. Rather than drop the old material entirely, I
created a <a href="./articles/history.html">new history of Winsock article</a>
from it.</p>

<p class=inset>Major updates to the text, both to fix up problems and
to fill in what I&rsquo;ve learned since I last touched each item. Some
FAQ items have been all but rewritten!</p>

<p class=inset>Some hopelessly outdated questions removed, a few added,
and a few others re-asked to broaden their scope a bit.</p>

<p class=inset>Some URL fixes, though the majority of that work is still
ahead, since I haven&rsquo;t gotten to the Resources section yet.</p>

<p class=inset>Replaced FreeFind search with Google custom search.</p>

<p class=inset>Major CSS and HTML style fixes, plus a little style
improvement. The parts of the FAQ that I&rsquo;ve touched validate now,
something they never have.</p>

<p><b>2006.03.24</b><br><p class=inset> Weeded the <a
href="resources/debugging.html">debugging tools</a> page: removed dead
products, updated prices, updated reviews of products I still use,
cleaned up presentation, etc.</p>

<p class=inset>Extracted glossary item about TCP into its own <a
href="intermediate.html#tcp">FAQ item</a>.</p>

<p class=inset>Renamed <a href="intermediate.html#udp">FAQ item about UDP</a>
to match better with new TCP item.</p>

<p class=inset>Several small clarifications and fixes to UDP FAQ
items.</p>

<p><b>2005.01.11</b><br><p class=inset> Added a link to a <code>poll()</code>
wrapper for <code>select()</code> to the <a href="./articles/bsd-compatibility.html">BSD sockets
compatibility article</a>.</p>

<p><b>2004.02.26</b><br><p class=inset> Major refresh. Fixed broken links,
primarily.</p>

<p><b>2001.10.17</b><br><p class=inset> Rewrote the "<a
href="advanced.html#maxsockets">maximum number of simultaneous
sockets</a>" FAQ item for clarity and to keep up with recent
findings.</p>

<p><b>2001.09.21</b><br><p class=inset> Fixed a few problems in the <a
href="examples/packetize.html">packetizing example</a> pointed out by Craig
Schmackpfeffer, and added some info explaining the limitations of the
code.</p>

<p><b>2001.09.06</b><br><p class=inset> Added the <a href="examples/packetize.html">How
to Packetize a TCP Stream</a> article.  This is based on code that
was in the <a href="articles/effective-tcp.html">How to Use TCP Effectively</a>
article, but this new version is standalone, compilable code instead of
pseudocode, and it has only one <code>recv()</code> call, instead of two. A
double <code>recv()</code> is <a href="intermediate.html#silly-window">bad
Winsock programming style</a>.</p>

<p class=inset> Expanded the old item on detecting a modem connection
to deal with the broader issue of detecting any Internet connection.
Also, added Elmue&rsquo;s RAS checking example, which supports this FAQ item.
Thanks for the code, Elmue!</p>

<p><b>2001.08.26</b><br><p class=inset> Added several libraries and web page
links, plus fixed a few FAQ items.

<p><b>2001.07.10</b><br><p class=inset> Made links to each of the <a
href="examples/basics/">basic examples</a> in the table of contents,
below. Before, there was just the overarching section header (6.1),
which didn&rsquo;t tell you that there were several major items underneath
it.</p>

<p><b>2001.03.26</b><br><p class=inset> Several minor updates, mainly in the
Resources section.

<p><b>2001.02.10</b><br><p class=inset> Did another update to the <a
href="articles/io-strategies.html">I/O strategies article</a>: I added one new
heuristic, and made several improvements to the existing material.</p>

<p><b>2001.02.06</b><br><p class=inset> Did a minor re-write on the <a
href="articles/io-strategies.html">I/O strategies article</a>. I clarified some
my advice on non-blocking sockets (Heuristic 2), split some information
out of the old Heuristic 2 into its own item (Heuristic 3, now), and
removed some redundant and misleading advice about asynchronous sockets
from Heuristic 4. I also added Heuristic 12, on designing your program
around the protocol.</p>

<p><b>2001.01.23</b><br><p class=inset> Made several clarifications to the <a
href="articles/bsd-compatibility.html">BSD sockets compatibility</a> article.</p>

<p><b>2000.12.18</b><br><p class=inset> Added an item that has a link that will
<a href="general.html#leaving-list">get you off the Winsock 2 Mailing
List</a>.</p>

<p><b>2000.11.27</b><br><p class=inset> Split the sample code resources section
into two parts: <a href="resources/tutorials.html">tutorial code</a> and <a
href="resources/samples.html">useful code</a>. Also checked and updated all
the links, and added links to a few new bits of sample code.</p>

<p><b>2000.11.17</b><br><p class=inset> Added info to the question on <a
href="intermediate.html#getipaddr">getting the local IP address</a>
and to the <a href="examples/ipaddr.html">page of one of the associated
examples</a> noting that essentially all TCP/IP machines have more than
one network interface. The new info explains why this is so and how your
program can deal with this fact. This also covers issues surrounding
multihomed systems.</p>

<p><b>2000.10.28</b><br><p class=inset> Added info to the "<a
href="articles/othersys.html">using sockets on other systems</a>" article
about the PalmOS.</p>

<p><b>2000.10.26</b><br><p class=inset> Fixed a few problems in the <a
href="examples/basics/select-server.html"><code>select()</code>-based server
example</a> pointed out by Wojtek Pilorz, and added some clarifiying
commentary.</p>

<p><b>2000.10.24</b><br><p class=inset> Moved the "Is there Winsock for ..."
question into <a href="articles/othersys.html">its own article</a>, as it
was very large. (This has to do with using Winsock and similar mechanisms
on non-Windows systems.) Then I enhanced the coverage, particularly in
the "Winsock for DOS" area.</p>

<p class=inset> Ditto for the new <a
href="articles/passing-sockets.html">passing a socket to another process
article</a>.</p>

<p><b>2000.09.28</b><br><p class=inset> As I frequently do, I went back and
re-read the <a href="articles/firewalls.html">firewalls article</a>, and
made several minor improvements.</p>

<p><b>2000.09.21</b><br><p class=inset> Fixed a typo in the <a
href="articles/io-strategies.html">Which I/O Strategy Should I Use?</a> article:
to support 1024 sockets with event objects, you need 16 threads, not 64
threads. Kudos for this catch go to John F. Keaveney.</p>

<p class=inset> Noted <a href="advanced.html#macaddr">one other
method</a> for discovering MAC addresses: the IP Helper API has a function
that will return this info. Thanks to Tim Eyre for pointing this out.</p>

<p class=inset> Craig Morrison has started several <a
href="http://www.2cah.com/protocol/">mailing lists</a> for implementors
of email, FTP and web (HTTP) programs.</p>

<p class=inset> Added a new article on <a href="articles/passing-sockets.html">how
to pass a socket from one process to another</a>. This is an expansion of
information that was already in the FAQ. The original FAQ item discussed
how to do it under Winsock 2, but Frank Schmied showed how you can do
it under Winsock 1.1 on Win32 as well.</p>

<p class=inset> Collected the two existing firewall FAQ items and
turned them into a new article, "<a href="articles/firewalls.html">Dealing
with Firewalls</a>". The original FAQ items were article-length already,
and I wanted to add info on accessing a server behind a firewall, so it
was time to take them out of the main FAQ.</p>

<p><b>2000.09.03</b><br><p class=inset> Added an item on the various _WAIT
states shown by the netstat tool. It just points readers to the "<a
href="articles/debugging-tcp.html">Debugging TCP</a>" article which has been
around for a long time, but I realized that it wasn&rsquo;t clear that the
FAQ covered such issues.</p>

<p><b>2000.08.13</b><br><p class=inset> Added info about WinPCap to the <a
href="advanced.html#pktcapture">packet capturing</a> FAQ item.
(WinPCap is a free library used for writing packet sniffers.)</p>

<p><b>2000.08.12</b><br><p class=inset> Merged three items in the General section
that talked about <a href="general.html#version">Winsock versions
and where to get Winsock</a>. They really were just several parts of the
same question.</p>

<p class=inset> Updated the "<a href="general.html#nextrev">When
is the next revision of the Winsock spec due out?</a>" item to note that
Winsock is slowly evolving, though no new specs are coming out.</p>

<p><b>2000.08.10</b><br><p class=inset> Fixed a potential bug in the
error message lookup function in the basic example programs&rsquo; common
ws_util.cpp module. (STL&rsquo;s <code>lower_bound()</code> doesn&rsquo;t
always return &ldquo;one past the end&rdquo; when it fails to find
what you asked for.)</p>

<p class=inset> Added a pair of items on <a
href="newbie.html#peeking">peeking</a> and <a
href="newbie.html#oobdata">out-of-band (OOB) data</a>. These are
related because they&rsquo;re both enabled by optional flags to <code>recv()</code>
and <code>send()</code>.</p>

<p class=inset> Alun Jones sent me a whole spate of small additions,
and clarifications pointing out the places where what I meant to say and
what the FAQ actually says were at odds. Several real technical problems
were corrected, too.</p>

<p><b>2000.07.04</b><br><p class=inset> There is an implementation of the
<a href="articles/bsd-compatibility.html#poll">Unix <code>poll()</code> function</a> for
Winsock. Added info about it to the BSD compatibility article.</p>

<p class=inset> There were two places mentioning the RPC method of
getting the machine&rsquo;s MAC address. Microsoft has broken this feature in
at least one patch for Windows 95 and in Windows "2000". Since the feature
wasn&rsquo;t all that reliable anyway, these references have been replaced
with warnings not to use the feature. I could have just removed the
references, but the feature is well-known and often recommended because
it&rsquo;s so simple. It&rsquo;s the FAQ&rsquo;s place to stand up and say, "This is the
wrong answer for this question."</p>

<p><b>2000.07.03</b><br><p class=inset> Added an <a
href="examples/basics/AsyncClient/index.html">asynchronous I/O client</a> program to
the <a href="examples/basics/index.html">Basic Winsock Examples</a> section.</p>

<p class=inset> Added an asynchronous I/O client <a
href="examples/basics/CASClient/index.html">based on CAsyncSocket</a> instead of calling
the Winsock async API directly. These two examples are useful in and
of themselves, but they&rsquo;re also interesting to compare to each other to
see how the MFC wrapper helps (and hinders!) over the plain API.</p>

<p class=inset> As a result of writing those two programs, I updated
the <i><a href="articles/csocket.html">CSocket Considered Harmful</a></i>
article.</p>

<p class=inset> Some kind readers pointed out that there is in fact
an SSL mechanism built into Windows NT 4.0 SP4+ and Windows "2000". The
<a href="intermediate.html#ssl">SSL FAQ item</a> has been updated to
reflect this.</p>

<p><b>2000.06.29</b><br><p class=inset> Updated the item on <a
href="advanced.html#macaddr">getting the machine&rsquo;s MAC address</a>.
It was becoming quite inaccurate.</p>

<p class=inset> Added an item discussing <a
href="intermediate.html#ssl">how to get SSL encryption</a> for your
programs.</p>

<p><b>2000.06.28</b><br><p class=inset> Added an item discussing
the various reasons why NT Server is the only legitimate <a
href="intermediate.html#high-load">server platform</a> for high
loads.</p>

<p class=inset> Updated the <a
href="advanced.html#backlog">connection backlog</a> item a bit: added
info on the backlog limitations in various MS OSes, and discussed why
and when this matters.</p>

<p class=inset> Added two new items on UDP: "<a
href="intermediate.html#udp">What is UDP?</a>", and "<a
href="intermediate.html#udpgood">What is UDP good for?</a>".</p>

<p class=inset> Split the links to related FAQs out of the Web Pages
resource section into their own section.</p>

<p><b>2000.06.27</b><br><p class=inset> Added an item regarding the proper
value for a server&rsquo;s <a href="advanced.html#backlog">connection
backlog</a>.</p>

<p><b>2000.06.20</b><br><p class=inset> Fixed the description of the <a
href="intermediate.html#nagle-desc">Nagle algorithm</a>. I blame
the store that sold me all that Jolt. They should never let me buy such
things. :)</p>

<p><b>2000.06.18</b><br><p class=inset> Added definitions of TCP and UDP to
the <a href="glossary.html">glossary</a>.</p>

<p><b>2000.06.16</b><br><p class=inset> Added a new item, "<a
href="intermediate.html#fw-politics">What if the firewall does not
support SOCKS?</a>" This deals with the politics of getting through
a firewall where the admins have blocked all but a few ports, and your
app is written to use one of the blocked ports.</p>

<p><b>2000.06.14</b><br><p class=inset> Updated the <a
href="glossary.html">glossary</a> with several new
items, and improved many others.</p>

<p class=inset> Moved the main text of some of the
longer glossary items into the main FAQ. The new items are <a
href="intermediate.html#nagle-desc">What is the Nagle algorithm?</a>,
<a href="intermediate.html#tcp-window">What is TCP&rsquo;s sliding
window?</a>, <a href="intermediate.html#silly-window">What is the silly
window syndrome?</a>, and <a href="intermediate.html#delayed-ack">What
is the delayed ACK algorithm?</a>.</p>

<p class=inset> Added an item for the true newbies, <a
href="general.html#tcp-vs-winsock">What&rsquo;s the difference between
Winsock and TCP/IP?</a>. I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed the need for the item
if I hadn&rsquo;t seen the question on a newsgroup....</p>

<p class=inset> Added an item covering the <a
href="general.html#mail-and-news">newsgroups and mailing lists</a>
that cover Winsock and TCP/IP.</p>

<p class=inset> Added info on <a href="general.html#othersys">Winsock
for the Macintosh</a> (Yes, there is such a beast!)</p>

<p><b>2000.06.12</b><br><p class=inset> Today I did a major update to the <a
href="articles/bsd-compatibility.html">BSD sockets compatibility article</a>. This includes
new info on #include file differences, discussion of BSD&rsquo;s
<code>fcntl()</code> system call, and greatly expanded info on file/socket
handle compatiblity under Windows. Also corrected and expanded the
&ldquo;errno vs. WSAGetLastError()&rdquo; item. There are a few other
minor improvements to the article.</p>

<p class=inset> Expanded the FAQ item that talked about the
FD_SETSIZE limitation of 64 sockets. (This causes <code>select()</code> to
not be usable in some situations with more than 64 sockets.) The <a
href="advanced.html#64sockets">FAQ item</a> now talks about a related
limitation, having to do with Winsock event objects.</p>

<p><b>2000.05.24</b><br><p class=inset> Doug Martin rightly pointed
out that RAS isn&rsquo;t available on all systems, so simply using the
<code>RasEnumConnections()</code> API to check for an Internet connection through
a modem will make the application not run at all on those systems. I have
updated <a href="intermediate.html#modemconn">the relevant FAQ item</a>
to show how to handle this case.</p>

<p><b>2000.05.18</b><br><p class=inset> The numbers were literally off by an order
of magnitude in my <a href="advanced.html#windowsize">TCP window
size</a> item. So, I changed the example from 10BaseT to 100BaseT and
recomputed. Now the question matches my predetermined answers. :)</p>

<p><b>2000.05.16</b><br><p class=inset> Rewrote the item about <a
href="advanced.html#windowsize">TCP window sizes</a>. The new version
is clearer and provides more information.</p>

<p class=inset> I just found out that the MFC tradition of bad network
class design continues in their new CCESocket class. I almost added an
item to the main FAQ to discuss it, but then I realized I was starting
to get very...shall we say...editorial. So, I converted the existing
CSocket item to an <a href="articles/csocket.html">article</a> and added
the CCESocket material to that.</p>

<p class=inset> Reorganized several FAQ answers to be more positive:
caveats or warnings are now at the end of items rather than up
front. Before, some items sounded naggy, especially to those who already
knew the caveats.</p>

<p class=inset> Added an item that covers the "<a
href="intermediate.html#asyncreliable">are asynch sockets
reliable?</a>" issue.

<p><b>2000.05.12</b><br><p class=inset> Added an item discussing the <a
href="advanced.html#windowsize">TCP window size</a>.</p>

<p class=inset> Added a Resources section covering <a
href="resources/kb.html">interesting MS Knowledge Base</a> articles.</p>

<p><b>2000.05.01</b><br><p class=inset> Added <a
href="examples/basics/threaded-server.html">multithreaded server</a> and <a
href="examples/basics/select-server.html">select()-based server</a> example
programs.</p>

<p class=inset> Updated basic examples&rsquo; Makefile so that it works
with several command line compilers: Visual C++ 5.0 (and hopefully 6.0),
the free version of Borland C++ 5.5, and Cygnus&rsquo; port of GNU C++ 2.91
(Cygwin 1.0).</p>

<p><b>2000.04.25</b><br><p class=inset> Added info to the item about <a
href="newbie.html#abnormalclose">detecting abnormal disconnects</a>
warning against using keepalives to detect these sorts of problems.</p>

<p><b>2000.04.24</b><br><p class=inset> Fixed several &ldquo;point-0&rdquo;
problems. (Yes, FAQs have them, too!)</p>

<p><b>2000.04.23</b><br><p class=inset> Finished the redesign. This also marks
the first FAQ announcement in several months.</p>

<p class=inset> Added the review of Jones and Ohlund&rsquo;s <i><a
href="reviews/npwindows.html">Network Programming for Microsoft
Windows</a></i>.</p>

<p class=inset> Added an article by Tom Sanfilippo that
shows <a href="articles/wscontrol.html">how to use the undocumented
<code>WsControl()</code> function</a>. This function is used by Windows
95&rsquo;s winipcfg program to view and change various IP parameters. There
is no documented way to get at a lot of this info, so this article is
very welcome! Thanks, Tom!</p>

<p class=inset> (I didn&rsquo;t plan it, but this "FAQ rebirth" occurred on
Easter Sunday. Apropriate, no?)</p>

<p><b>2000.03.26</b><br><p class=inset> Today I began a total revamp of the
FAQ&rsquo;s look, content and organization. Virtually every FAQ item got minor
changes, and several have been completely rewritten.</p>

<p class=inset> The FAQ&rsquo;s organization is rather different
now, too. Many of the items from the previous &ldquo;newbie&rdquo;
and &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; sections have been culled to make a new
"intermediate" section. Another problem I fixed is that the old
FAQ organization required that I always add new items at the end
of a section instead of near related items. For the same reason,
the previous FAQ organization didn&rsquo;t allow me to delete or
move items. For these reasons and others, if you had hyperlinks to
particular items on these pages, they are definitely now broken!</p>

<p class=inset> Most importantly for you, the reader, is that I&rsquo;ve made
quite an effort to make this FAQ more maintainable. Hopefully this will
decrease the amount of procrastinating I do, so changes and additions
will get done on a more timely schedule.</p>

<line>

<h4>NOTE: I removed all hyperlinks from this point forward since the
redesign pretty much made them all bogus.</h4>

<line>

<p><b>1999.09.25</b><br>
<p class=inset>Added some more info to the BSD Sockets Compatibility
tutorial.</p>

<p><b>1999.08.30</b></p>
<p class=inset>Updated the ICMP Ping Example so that it compiles cleaner,
and updated the commentary to note that the program still works on
Microsoft&rsquo;s newest platforms (Win98 and Win2K) despite their past threats
to remove the API.</p>

<p class=inset>Added some new info on the &ldquo;how many sockets can
you have open&rdquo; problem discussed in Question 3.16. The new info
discloses kernel internals that limit the number of sockets you can
create on Windows NT 4.0 and Windows "2000". The item also includes
some empirical data I&rsquo;ve collected from Internet postings;
some conclusions are drawn based on this data and the known kernel
algorithms. I also added some info on increasing the low hard limit
imposed under Win9x.</p>

<p class=inset>Improved the accuracy of the info on waitable timers in
Question 2.14.</p>

<p class=inset>Added the Search function, courtesy of FreeFind.</p>

<p class=inset>Added Question 2.18, regarding the Winsock link
library. (This question comes up with distressing frequency, so I broke
down and added it to the FAQ. What <i>is</i> the world coming to? :-/)</p>

<p><b>1999.07.19</b></p>
<p class=inset>Updated the new &ldquo;raw socket capabilities&rdquo;
table in item 3.1 with new information on what Windows 2000 will
support.</p>

<p><b>1999.06.27</b></p>
<p class=inset>Fixed several broken links and added a number of new
items to the Debugging page of the FAQ&rsquo;s Resources section.</p>

<p class=inset>Improved item 2.15, regarding the best way to send a
broadcast packet.</p>

<p class=inset>Changed item 3.17. It used to say that only buggy Winsock
stacks and LSPs limited the number of sockets per <tt>select()</tt> to
64, but I&rsquo;ve been reliably informed that at least one respected Winsock
vendor&rsquo;s stack behaves this way, and they aren&rsquo;t willing to change it. So,
the FAQ item now recommends against trying to force your way past this
limitation.</p>

<p class=inset>Improved item 3.18, to note that its advice won&rsquo;t help work
around a certain Windows 9x bug, though it seems like it should help.</p>

<p class=inset>I just found out a way to get quasi-<tt>dup2()</tt>
functionality under Winsock. Thus, the BSD Compatibility and Question
3.3 items have been updated.</p>

<p class=inset>Added item 3.21, to point people wanting to know about
the control bits in a TCP packet to the Debugging TCP tutorial which
covers this.</p>

<p class=inset>Added item 2.17, regarding advice for choosing server
ports.</p>

<p><b>1999.04.12</b></p>
<p class=inset>Revamped Tutorial 4. I reworked the existing text, added
some examples and went into more depth on some topics. More importantly,
I changed the title from "Why Does Winsock Keep Corrupting My Data?" to
"How to Use TCP Effectively". In the eight months that the tutorial has
been online, I&rsquo;ve come to realize that the original title was not quite
accurate, so that many who should have read the tutorial were skipping
over it because they didn&rsquo;t realize that it applied to problems they
were having.</p>

<p class=inset>Updated Question 2.14 with information on aborting a wait
on an event object by using a waitable timer.</p>

<p class=inset>Added Question 2.15, regarding broadcasting.</p>

<p class=inset>Split Question 2.8: the new Q2.8 deals with normal TCP
disconnects. The rest of the information from the old Q2.8, having to
do with abnormal network disconnects, is now in Question 2.16.</p>

<p class=inset>Reports indicate that my getifaces sample fails on Windows
95, so I&rsquo;ve updated that page to reflect this.</p>

<p><b>1999.04.08</b></p>
<p class=inset>Tweaked some of the answers in Section 3 for accuracy.</p>

<p><b>1999.04.05</b></p>
<p class=inset>Item 3.14 basically said &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t do
that&ldquo; to people wanting to do low-level network I/O. That&rsquo;s
only true if you&rsquo;re just talking about the Winsock API. The
current answer for that question breaks out of that box and provides
pointers to other mechanisms for accessing the lower levels of the
network stack.</p>

<p class=inset>I normally don&rsquo;t announce updates to the pages in the
Resources section, because most often the changes merely reflect a site
that has moved or something similarly trivial. This latest change is
fairly significant, though: the Web Pages page now has links to a number
of related FAQs.</p>

<p><b>1999.03.25</b></p>
<p class=inset>Small changes to this main page and also to the Mirrors
section.</p>

<p><b>1999.03.21</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added item 0.6, which explains the FAQ&rsquo;s programming
language bias and the reasons for it. Note that I moved the old item
0.6 (Acknowledgements) to 0.7. I did this because I prefer to keep the
Acknowledgements section in its traditional place, at the end of the
introductory material.</p>

<p class=inset>Simplified the answer to Question 0.5, which discusses
the reasons I prefer not to answer Winsock questions by email.</p>

<p class=inset>Updated Question 1.6, mainly with more information on
alternatives to Winsock for DOS programmers. Also added a paragraph to
clear up the confusion between a DOS program and a console mode program
which happens to run in a "DOS box" on Win32. (Many people, when they
say they want to write a Winsock program that runs under DOS, really
just want a console mode program.)</p>

<p><b>1999.03.17</b></p>
<p class=inset>(<font color=green>Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Day</font>!) Updated
Question 2.7 again, this time to clarify the language issues some
more.</p>

<p class=inset>Revamped the answer to Question 3.9 again. I looked back
over the previous update and was still unhappy with the way the item
was phrased. So, I started working on it and ended up rewriting the
whole item!</p>

<p class=inset>As a result of the previous change, I touched up Question
3.10, because it referred to the old Q3.9 language.</p>

<p><b>1999.03.12</b></p>
<p class=inset>Updated Question 2.7 to better cover the issues associated
with programming Winsock in languages other than C or C++.</p>

<p class=inset>Clarified the answer to Question 3.9, regarding warnings
about accessing a single socket from multiple threads.</p>

<p class=inset>Added information to Tutorial 4 on sending non-integer
data across platforms.</p>

<p><b>1999.03.01</b></p>
<p class=inset>Fixed a bug in basic-client.cpp from Example 10. Thanks
for the bug catch go to Jerome Jacobsen.</p>

<p><b>1999.02.23</b></p>
<p class=inset>Made a minor update to Question 2.10.</p>

<p class=inset>Added Question 2.14, having to do with timeouts and
blocking Winsock functions.</p>

<p><b>1999.02.21</b></p>
<p class=inset>Updated the OS/2 entry in Question 1.6.</p>

<p><b>1999.02.16</b></p>
<p class=inset>Reworked Introduction page to be part of the main FAQ
(Section 0).</p>

<p><b>1999.01.04</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added the basic-server example to Example 10.</p>

<p><b>1998.12.24</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added a few items to the BSD sockets compatibility
tutorial.</p>

<p><b>1998.12.14</b></p>
<p class=inset>Fixed a problem with Question 2.8, and generally improved
the answer to that question and to Question 2.12.</p>

<p><b>1998.11.24</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added the first &ldquo;basic Winsock client&rdquo;
example program. More clients and also some server programs will
follow in the series.</p>

<p><b>1998.11.22</b></p>
<p class=inset>Touched up several FAQ entries that refered to other
people&rsquo;s copy of the Lame List to point to the version I just added.</p>

<p><b>1998.11.20</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added a copy of The Lame List to the Tutorials
section. Must reading!</p>

<p class=inset>Several minor changes, especially to the newer items
added on the sixth of this month.</p>

<p><b>1998.11.06</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added Tutorial 5, which introduces the reader to the
black magic of low-level TCP debugging. In particular, it covers the
<tt>netstat</tt> tool and the TCP/IP state/transition diagram &mdash;
how to read it, what to do when you get into problem states, how
to diagnose the current state of the system, etc.</p>

<p class=inset>Reworked Question 2.9 a bit as a result of the new
Tutorial. (It used to be called "How can I debug my Winsock program?",
for example. Clearly inappropriate given the new material, and what the
Question actually covered.)</p>

<p class=inset>Updated Question 2.8. The new Answer is more cosmopolitan
in its advice, and it also addresses abnormal-disconnect issues, whereas
the previous Answer only covered normal disconnects.</p>

<p><b>1998.10.26</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added Question 2.12, having to do with the proper way to
close a socket.</p>

<p class=inset>Added Question 2.13, regarding MFC&rsquo;s CAsyncSocket and
CSocket classes.</p>

<p class=inset>Added Question 3.18, regarding a method to bypass the
routing layer on a machine with multiple network interfaces.</p>

<p class=inset>Added Question 3.19, which is about using SOCKS to drill
through a firewall.</p>

<p class=inset>Added Question 3.20, regarding whether it is a good plan
to call <tt>bind()</tt> in a client program.</p>

<p class=inset>Numerous other minor updates.</p>

<p><b>1998.09.27</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added support for changing the TTL value to the raw
sockets ping program.</p>

<p><b>1998.09.19</b></p>
<p class=inset>Updated the much-neglected Section 1.</p>

<p class=inset>I just discovered that Question 2.12, which I added
almost two months ago, is essentially identical to Question 2.2. You
know your FAQ is getting big when.... Anyway, I nixed Question 2.12,
and used its text in place of the less-well-written 2.2 text.</p>

<p><b>1998.09.07</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added Reviews section, and wrote the first five book
reviews for it.</p>

<p><b>1998.08.23</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added Questions 3.16 and 3.17, regarding issues of
&ldquo;how many sockets can Winsock handle.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>1998.08.01</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added Tutorial 3. This material largely supercedes
Questions 3.4 and 3.7, so those items have also changed.</p>

<p class=inset>Turned Questions 2.12 and 2.13 into Tutorial 4.</p>

<p class=inset>Added a new Question 2.12, regarding how to speak various
common protocols, like HTTP and FTP.</p>

<p class=inset>Added a new Question 3.4, regarding using the SNMP API for
accessing the routing table, the ARP table, the interface list, etc. (It
replaces the old Question 3.4, which was superceded by Tutorial 3.)</p>

<p class=inset>Updated several of the entries regarding Windows 98.</p>

<p><b>1998.07.31</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added two more network monitoring packages to the Debugging
portion of the FAQ&rsquo;s Resources section.</p>

<p class=inset>Replaced Tutorial 2 with a new, completely-rewritten
version.</p>

<p><b>1998.05.19 and 1998.05.20</b></p>
<p class=inset>Improved the wording of Question 3.15.</p>

<p><b>1998.04.28</b></p>
<p class=inset>Fixed a broken link.</p>

<p><b>1998.04.19</b></p>
<p class=inset>Updated Question 1.9 and also the Resources section.</p>

<p><b>1998.03.23</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added info on structure-padding issues to Question
2.13.</p>

<p class=inset>Updated Question 2.10 by removing the rumor that
<tt>FormatMessage</tt> can return error messages for Winsock error
numbers. I have since found out that at best this is undocumented behavior
that only works on one or two of Microsoft&rsquo;s Winsock implementations. It
is by no means a universal thing.</p>

<p><b>1998.03.22</b></p>
<p class=inset>Split Resources page up so that each sub-section has its
own page.

<p class=inset>Put the index pages for all the sections with their own
directory in that directory. Now, the HTML file of the same name is
just a redirector. For example, the old examples.html file is now at
examples/index.html, and examples.html automatically forwards you to
the new page.</p>

<p class=inset>Added a few new sniffers to the Debugging Resources
subsection and updated most of the the existing entries.</p>

<p><b>1998.02.23</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added a bit of info to the Get Interface List example.</p>

<p class=inset>Added a bug note to the Get MAC Address (NetBIOS version)
example.</p>

<p><b>1998.02.16</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added Questions 3.13 and 3.14, concerning raw sockets
and such. Also updated Question 3.1 to reference the new questions for
more information.</p>

<p class=inset>Added Question 3.15, concerning the time and place for
turning off the Nagle algorithm.</p>

<p class=inset>Added a number of glossary entries.</p>

<p><b>1998.02.14</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added the &ldquo;raw ping&rdquo; example. Also touched
up the answers to questions 3.1, 3.2, 3.8 and 1.7.</p>

<p><b>1998.02.02</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added a new tutorial, <i> Winsock for the
Impatient</i>.</p>

<p class=inset>Updated the Glossary some, mainly the router, gateway
and bridge entries and other related things.</p>

<p><b>1998.02.01</b></p>
<p class=inset>Updated Questions 1.3 and 1.8 with better Winsock
2 info.</p>

<p class=inset>Expanded Question 3.9 and split it up into Questions
3.9 through 3.11. Because they are all related, I didn&rsquo;t put the new
questions at the end of the list, as I usually do. Instead, the old
Question 3.10 is now Question 3.12.</p>

<p class=inset>Had one of those periodic whole-FAQ editing fits, and
ended up re-working a lot of the text, partly for accuracy, partly to
fill in missing detail, and partly just so that it reads better.</p>

<p><b>1998.01.31</b></p>
<p class=inset>Fixed a minor problem in Question 3.8.</p>

<p class=inset>Added Question 2.10, which explains how to get a readable
error message from a Winsock error number.</p>

<p class=inset>Added Question 2.11, which sheds some light on the
poorly-understood WSAEWOULDBLOCK error.</p>

<p class=inset>Added Question 2.12, which deals with the common
misconceptions about how TCP &ldquo;should&rdquo; work versus how it
actually does work.</p>

<p class=inset>Added Question 2.13, which talks about &ldquo;network
order&rdquo; for integers.</p>

<p class=inset>Added Question 3.9, which deals with the behavior of
asynchronous sockets in a multithreaded program.</p>

<p class=inset>Added Question 3.10, which explains how to tell if the
modem is connected on systems with dial-up networking.</p>

<p class=inset>Added the &ldquo;get interfaces&rdquo; example.</p>

<p><b>1998.01.19</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added the Tutorials section. The first one is the
information from the way-too-long answer to Question 2.4, in article
format. The new answer to Question 2.4 mainly just summarizes the article
and points readers to it for more information.</p>

<p><b>1998.01.17</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added Winsock debugging tools section to Resources
page.</p>

<p class=inset>Added Question 2.9 to introduce the new debugging tools
section.</p>

<p><b>1998.01.16</b></p>
<p class=inset>Updated the Introduction page significantly. If you
haven&rsquo;t read through it recently, you may want to give it a
quick skim, especially the &ldquo;future directions&rdquo; section
and the short-and-unoriginal legal statement.</p>

<p><b>1998.01.12</b></p>
<p class=inset>Updated Question 2.7 to be correct some misconceptions
present in earlier versions.</p>

<p class=inset>Expanded and reorganized the Resources section
significantly.</p>

<p class=inset>Clarified and enhanced Question 1.6.</p>

<p><b>1998.01.04</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added the &ldquo;get MAC address&rdquo; examples
(NetBIOS and RPC methods). Also added Question 3.8 to introduce
those examples.</p>

<p class=inset>Enhanced Question 3.1, adding more details about
the support for raw sockets on Microsoft and other Winsock
implementations.</p>

<p class=inset>Split Question 2.4 into Questions 2.4a, 2.4b, and
2.4c. Each part is now greatly enhanced, resulting in a much broader
and tolerant answer. [Obsolete &mdash; see the note for 1998.01.19
for newer info].</p>

<p><b>1997.10.27</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added some info to Question 3.3. Also changed the wording
to use Microsoft&rsquo;s preferred term &ldquo;process&rdquo; rather
than &ldquo;task.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>1997.10.09</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added the Glossary</p>

<p><b>1997.10.07</b></p>
<p class=inset>Added this list.</p>

<p class=inset>Improved answer to Question 2.3, including a second
method for getting the local IP address, and adding some caveats to the
first method.</p>

<p class=inset>Refined answer to Question 2.4, making the distinction
between non-blocking and blocking sockets. What was previously called
non-blocking is now called &ldquo;asynchronous.&rdquo; (This was not
incorrect, just imprecise.) Also corrected some misconceptions about
the behavior of blocking sockets.</p>
