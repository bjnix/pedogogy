<h3>The Lame List</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>I have reproduced The Lame List here because it is so valuable. This
text is cut-and-pasted directly from Appendix C of version 2.2.2 of
the <i>Windows Sockets 2 Application Programming Interface</i>. The
list originally started out as a list of complaints by Winsock stack
vendors about wrongheaded applications created back when Winsock was
new and not as well understood. Despite that, these items are still
valuable because newbie Winsockers still make the same wrongheaded
mistakes. Avoiding the items on this list will take you a long way
along the road toward Winsock guruhood.</p>

<p>This version of the List is slightly different from the original:
I have changed some punctuation, minor bits of phrasing, etc. And,
of course, I have added all the pretty HTML formatting.</p>

<h5>The original introduction to the List:</h5>

<p><i>Keith Moore of Microsoft gets the credit for starting this,
but other folks have begun contributing as well. Bob Quinn, from
sockets.com, is the kind soul who provided the elaborations on why
these things are lame and what to do instead. This is a snapshot
of the list as we went to print (plus a few extras thrown in at the
last minute).</i></p>

<h4>The Windows Sockets Lame List<br>
(or What&rsquo;s Weak This Week)</h4>

<p><i>Brought to you by The Windows Sockets Vendor Community</i></p>

<ol>
  <li>Calling <code>connect()</code> on a non-blocking socket, getting
  <code>WSAEWOULDBLOCK</code>, then immediately calling <code>recv()</code>
  and expecting <code>WSAEWOULDBLOCK</code> before the connection has
  been established. <i>Lame.</i><br><br>

  Reason: This assumes that the connection will never be established by
  the time the application calls <code>recv()</code>. Lame assumption.<br><br>

  Alternative: Don&rsquo;t do that.  An application using a
  non-blocking socket must handle the <code>WSAEWOULDBLOCK</code>
  error value, but must not depend on occurrence of the error.

  <p>
  <li>Calling <code>select()</code> with three empty <code>fd_set</code>s
  and a valid <code>TIMEOUT</code> structure as a sleazy delay
  function. <i>Inexcusably lame.</i><br><br>

  Reason: The <code>select()</code> function is intended as a network
  function, not a general purpose timer.<br><br>

  Alternative: Use a legitimate system timer service.

  <p>
  <li>Polling with <code>connect()</code> on a non-blocking socket to
  determine when the connection has been established. <i>Dog
  lame.</i><br><br>

  Reason: The Winsock 1.1 spec does not define an error for
  <code>connect()</code> when a non-blocking connection is pending, so the
  error value returned may vary.<br><br>

  Alternative: Using asynchronous notification of connection
  completion is the recommended alternative. An application that
  prefers synchronous operation mode could use the <code>select()</code>
  function (but <a href="#item23">see item 23</a>).<br><br>

  Non-Alternative: Changing a non-blocking socket to blocking mode
  to block on <code>send()</code> or <code>recv()</code> is even more lame than
  polling on <code>connect()</code>.

  <p>
  <a name=item4>
  <li>Assuming socket handles are always less than 16. <i>Mired in
  a sweaty mass of lameness.</i><br><br>

  Reason: The only invalid socket handle value is defined by the
  <code>winsock.h</code> file as <code>INVALID_SOCKET</code>. Any other
  value the <code>SOCKET</code> type can handle is fair game, and an
  application <i>must</i> handle it. In any case, socket handles are
  supposed to be opaque, so applications shouldn&rsquo;t depend on
  specific values for any reason.<br><br>

  Alternative: Expect a socket handle of any value, including 0. And
  don&rsquo;t expect socket handle values to change with each
  successive call to <code>socket()</code> or <code>WSASocket()</code>. Socket
  handles may be reused by the Winsock implementation.

  <p>
  <li>Polling with <code>select()</code> and a zero timeout in Win16&rsquo;s
  non-preemptive environment. <i>Nauseatingly lame.</i><br><br>

  Reason: With any non-zero timeout, <code>select()</code> will call the
  current blocking hook function, so an application anticipating an
  event will yield to other processes executing in a 16-bit Windows
  environment. However, with a zero timeout an application will not
  yield to other processes, and may not even allow network operations
  to occur (so it will loop forever).</P>

  Alternative: Use a small non-zero timeout. Better yet, use
  asynchronous notification instead of using <code>select()</code>.

  <p>
  <li>Calling <code>WSAAsyncSelect()</code> with
  a zero Event mask just to make the socket
  non-blocking. <i>Lame. Lame. Lame. Lame. Lame.</i><br><br>

  Reason: <code>WSAAsyncSelect()</code> is designed to allow an application
  to register for asynchronous notification of network events. The
  Winsock 1.1 specification didn&rsquo;t specify an error for a zero
  event mask, but may interpret it as an invalid input argument
  (so it may fail with <code>WSAEINVAL</code>), or silently ignore
  the request.<br><br>

  Alternative: To make a socket non-blocking without
  registering for asynchronous notification, use
  <code>ioctlsocket(FIONBIO)</code>. That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s for.

  <p>
  <a name="item7">
  <li>Telnet applications that neither enable
  <code>SO_OOBINLINE</code>, nor read OOB data. <i>Violently
  lame.</i><br><br>

  Reason: It is not uncommon for Telnet servers to generate urgent
  data, like when a Telnet client will send a Telnet BREAK command
  or Interrupt Process command. The server then employs a "Synch"
  mechanism which consists of a TCP Urgent notification coupled with
  the Telnet DATA MARK command. If the telnet client doesn&rsquo;t
  read the urgent data, then it won&rsquo;t get any more normal data.
  Not ever, ever, ever, ever.<br><br>

  Alternative: Every telnet client should be able to read and/or detect
  OOB data. They should either enable inline OOB data by calling
  <code>setsockopt(SO_OOBINLINE)</code>, or use <code>WSAAsyncSelect()</code>
  (or <code>WSAEventSelect()</code>) with <code>FD_OOB</code> or <code>select()</code>
  using <code>except_fds</code> to detect OOB data arrival, and call
  <code>recv()</code>/<code>WSARecv()</code> with <code>MSG_OOB</code> in response.

  <p>
  <li>Assuming 0 is an invalid socket handle value. <i>Uncontrollably
  lame.</i><br><br>

  Reason and Alternative: <a href="#item4">See item 4</a>.

  <p>
  <li>Applications that don&rsquo;t properly shut down when
  the user closes the main window while a blocking API is in
  progress. <i>Totally lame.</i><br><br>

  Reason: Winsock applications that don&rsquo;t close sockets, and
  call <code>WSACleanup()</code>, may not allow a Winsock implementation
  to reclaim resources used by the application. Resource leakage
  can eventually result in resource starvation by all other Winsock
  applications (i.e. network system failure).<br><br>

  Alternative: While a blocking API is in progress in a 16-bit Winsock
  1.1 application, the proper way to abort is to:<br><br>

  <ul type=disc>
    <li>Call <code>WSACancelBlockingCall()</code><br><br>

    <li>Wait until the pending function returns. If the cancellation
    occurs before the operation completes, the pending function will
    fail with the <code>WSAEINTR</code> error, but applications must
    also be prepared for success, due to the race condition involved
    with cancellation.<br><br>

    <li>Close this socket, and all other sockets. Note: the proper
    closure of a connected stream socket involves:<br><br>

    <ul type=disc>
      <li>call <code>shutdown()</code> with the <i>how</i> equal to 1
      <li>loop on <code>recv()</code> until it returns 0 or fails with any error
      <li>call <code>closesocket()</code>
      <li>Call <code>WSACleanup()</code>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <br>

  This procedure is not relevant to 32-bit Winsock 2 applications,
  since they really block, so calling <code>WSACancelBlockingCall()</code>
  from the same thread is impossible. (Therefore, this call is
  deprecated under Winsock 2.) However, the shutdown procedure above
  is still useful.

  <p>
  <li>Out of band data. <i>Intensely lame.</i><br><br>

  Reason: TCP can&rsquo;t do Out of Band (OOB) data reliably. If
  that isn&rsquo;t enough, there are incompatible differences
  in the implementation at the protocol level (in the
  urgent pointer offset). Berkeley (BSD) Unix implements
  <a href="../../rfcs/official.html#rfc793">RFC 793</a>
  literally, and many others implement the corrected <a
  href="../../rfcs/official.html#rfc1122">RFC 1122</a> version. (Some
  versions also allow multiple OOB data bytes by using the start of
  the MAC frame as the starting point for the offset.) If two TCP
  hosts have different OOB versions, they cannot send OOB data to
  each other.<br><br>

  Alternative: Ideally, you can use a separate socket for urgent data,
  although in reality it is inescapable sometimes. Some protocols
  require it (<a href="#item7">see item 7</a>), in which case you
  need to minimize your dependence, or beef up your technical support
  staff to handle user calls.

  <p>
  <li>Calling <code>strlen()</code> on a hostent structure&rsquo;s ip address,
  then truncating it to four bytes, thereby overwriting part of
  <code>malloc()</code>&rsquo;s heap header. <i>In all my years of observing
  lameness, I have seldom seen something this lame.</i><br><br>

  Reason: This doesn&rsquo;t really need a reason, does it?<br><br>

  Alternative: Clearly, the only alternative is a brain
  transplant.

  <p>
  <a name=item12>
  <li>Polling with <code>recv(MSG_PEEK)</code> to determine when
  a complete message has arrived. <i>Thrashing in a sea of
  lameness.</i><br><br>

  Reason: A stream socket (TCP) does not preserve message boundaries
  (<a href="#item20">see item 20</a>). An application that uses
  <code>recv(MSG_PEEK)</code> or <code>ioctlsocket(FIONREAD)</code> to wait
  for a complete message to arrive, may never succeed. One reason
  might be the internal service provider&rsquo;s buffering; if the
  bytes in a "message" straddle a system buffer boundary, the Winsock
  may never report the bytes that exist in other buffers.<br><br>

  Alternative: Don&rsquo;t use peek reads. Always read data into your
  application buffers, and examine the data there.

  <p>
  <li>Passing a longer buffer length than the actual buffer size
  since you know you won&rsquo;t receive more than the actual buffer
  size. <i>Universally lame.</i><br><br>

  Reason: Winsock implementations often check buffers for
  readability or writability before using them to avoid Protection
  Faults. When a buffer length is longer than the actual buffer
  length, this check will fail, so the function call will fail with
  <code>WSAEFAULT</code>.<br><br>

  Alternative: Always pass a legitimate buffer length.

  <p>
  <li>Bounding every set of operations with calls to
  <code>WSAStartup()</code> and <code>WSACleanup()</code>. <i>Pushing the
  lameness envelope.</i><br><br>

  Reason: This is not illegal, as long as each <code>WSAStartup()</code>
  has a matching call to <code>WSACleanup()</code>, but it is more work
  than necessary.<br><br>

  Alternative: In a DLL, custom control or class library, it is
  possible to register the calling client based on a unique task
  handle or process ID. This allows automatic registration without
  duplication. Automatic de-registration can occur when a process
  closes its last socket. This is even easier if you use the process
  notification mechanisms available in the 32-bit environment.

  <p>
  <li>Ignoring API errors. <i>Glaringly lame.</i><br><br>

  Reason: Error values are your friends! When a function fails, the
  error value returned by <code>WSAGetLastError()</code> or included in an
  asynchronous message can tell you <i>why</i> it failed. Based on
  the function that failed, and the socket state, you can often infer
  what happened, why, and what to do about it.<br><br>

  Alternative: Check for error values, and write your applications to
  anticipate them, and handle them gracefully when appropriate. When
  a fatal error occurs, always display an error message that
  shows:<br><br>

  <ul type=disc>
    <li>the function that failed
    <li>the Winsock error number, and/or macro
    <li>a short description of the error meaning
    <li>suggestions for how to remedy, when possible 
  </ul>

  <p>
  <li>Calling <code>recv(MSG_PEEK)</code> in response to an
  <code>FD_READ</code> async notification message. <i>Profoundly
  lame.</i><br><br>

  Reason: It&rsquo;s redundant. It&rsquo;s redundant.<br><br>

  Alternative: Make a plain <code>recv()</code> call in response
  to an <code>FD_READ</code> message. Even if it fails with
  <code>WSAEWOULDBLOCK</code>, that error is easy to ignore, and you
  are guaranteed to get another <code>FD_READ</code> message later
  since there is data pending.

  <p>
  <a name=item17>
  <li>Installing an empty blocking hook that just returns
  <code>FALSE</code>. <i>Floundering in an endless desert of
  lameness.</i><br><br>

  Reason: One of the primary purposes of the blocking hook function
  was to provide a mechanism for an application with a pending
  blocking operation to yield. By returning <code>FALSE</code> from the
  blocking hook function, you defeat this purpose and your application
  will prevent multitasking in the non-preemptive 16-bit Windows
  environment. This may also prevent some Winsock implementations
  from completing the pending network operation.<br><br>

  Alternative: Typically this hack is done to try to prevent reentrant
  messages. There are better ways to do this, like subclassing the
  active window, although, admittedly, preventing reentrant messages
  is not an easy problem to avoid.<br><br>

  Note that this is not an issue for Winsock 2 applications, since
  blocking hooks are now a thing of the past! (Good riddance.)

  <p>
  <a name=item18>
  <li>Client applications that bind to a specific port. <i>Suffocating
  in self lameness.</i><br><br>

  Reason: By definition, client applications actively initiate a
  network communication, unlike server applications which passively
  wait for communication. A server must <code>bind()</code> to a specific port
  which is known to clients that need to use the service, however,
  a client need not <code>bind()</code> its socket to a specific port in
  order to communicate with a server.<br><br>

  Not only is it unnecessary for all but a very few application
  protocols, it is dangerous for a client to <code>bind()</code> to a specific
  port number. There is a danger in conflicting with another socket
  that is already using the port number, which would cause the call
  to <code>bind()</code> to fail with <code>WSAEADDRINUSE</code>.<br><br>

  Alternative: Simply let the Winsock implementation assign the local
  port number implicitly when you call <code>connect()</code> (on stream or
  datagram sockets), or <code>sendto()</code> (on datagram sockets).

  <p>
  <a name=item19>
  <li>Nagle challenged applications. <i>Perilously teetering on the
  edge of a vast chasm of lameness.</i><br><br>

  Reason: The Nagle algorithm reduces trivial network traffic. In a
  nutshell, the algorithm says don&rsquo;t send a TCP segment until
  either:<br><br>

  <ul type=disc>
    <li>all outstanding TCP segments have been acknowledged; or
    <li>there&rsquo;s a full TCP segment ready to send
  </ul>
  <br>

  A "Nagle challenged application" is one that cannot wait until
  either of these conditions occurs, but has such time-critical data
  that it must send continuously. This results in wasteful network
  traffic.<br><br>

  Alternative: Don&rsquo;t write applications that depend on the
  immediate data echo from the remote TCP host.

  <p>
  <a name=item20>
  <li>Assuming stream sockets maintain message frame
  boundaries. <i>Mind bogglingly lame.</i><br><br>

  Reason: Stream sockets (TCP) are called stream sockets, because
  they provide data streams (duh). As such, the largest message size
  an application can ever depend on is one-byte in length. No more, no
  less. This means that with any call to <code>send()</code> or <code>recv()</code>,
  the Winsock implementation may transfer any number of bytes less
  than the buffer length specified.<br><br>

  Alternative: Whether you use a blocking or non-blocking socket,
  on success you should always compare the return from <code>send()</code>
  or <code>recv()</code> with the value you expected. If it is less than
  you expected, you need to adjust the buffer length, and pointer,
  for another function call (which may occur asynchronously, if you
  are using asynchronous operation mode).<br><br>

  <p>
  <li>16-bit DLLs that call <code>WSACleanup()</code> from their
  WEP. <i>Inconceivably lame.</i><br><br>

  Reason: <code>WEP()</code> is lame, ergo depending on it is lame. Seriously,
  16-bit Windows did not guarantee that <code>WEP()</code> would always be
  called, and the Windows subsystem was often in such a hairy state
  that doing <i>anything</i> in <code>WEP()</code> was dangerous.<br><br>

  Alternative: Stay away from <code>WEP()</code>.

  <p>
  <li>Single byte <code>send()</code>s and <code>recv()</code>s. <i>Festering
  in a pool of lameness.</i><br><br>

  Reason: Couple one-byte sends with Nagle disabled, and you have at
  best a 40:1 overhead-to-data ratio. Can you say wasted bandwidth? I
  thought you could.<br><br>

  As for one-byte receives, think of the effort and inefficiency
  involved with trying to drink a Guinness Stout through a hypodermic
  needle. That&rsquo;s about how your application would feel "drinking"
  data one-byte at a time.<br><br>

  Alternative: Consider Postel&rsquo;s <a
  href="../../rfcs/official.html#rfc793">RFC 793</a> words to live by:
  "Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
  others." In other words, send modest amounts, and receive as much
  as possible.

  <p>
  <a name=item23>
  <li><code>select()</code>. <i>Self abusively lame.</i><br><br>

  Reason: Consider the steps involved in using <code>select()</code>. You need
  to use the macros to clear the 3 <code>fd_set</code>s, then set the
  appropriate <code>fd_set</code>s for each socket, then set the timer,
  then call <code>select()</code>.<br><br>

  Then after <code>select()</code> returns with the number of sockets that
  have done something, you need to go through all the <code>fd_set</code>s
  and all the sockets using the macros to find the event that occurred,
  and even then the (lack of) resolution is such you need to infer
  the event from the current socket state.<br><br>

  Alternative: Use asynchronous operation mode
  (e.g. <code>WSAAsyncSelect()</code> or <code>WSAEventSelect()</code>).

  <p>
  <li>Applications that call <code>gethostbyname()</code> before calling
  <code>inet_addr()</code>. <i>Words fail to express such all-consuming
  lameness.</i><br><br>

  Reason: Some users prefer to use network addresses rather than
  hostnames at times. The Winsock 1.1 specification does not say what
  <code>gethostbyname()</code> should do with an IP address in standard
  ASCII dotted IP notation. As a result, it may succeed and do an
  (unnecessary) reverse-lookup, or it may fail.<br><br>

  Alternative: With any destination input by a user&mdash;which may
  be a hostname <i>or</i> dotted IP address&mdash;you should call
  <code>inet_addr()</code> <i>first</i> to check for an IP address, and if
  that fails call <code>gethostbyname()</code> to try to resolve it.<br><br>

  Furthermore, in some applications, you may want to explicitly
  check the input string for the broadcast address "255.255.255.255,"
  since the return value from <code>inet_addr()</code> for this address is
  the same as <code>SOCKET_ERROR</code>.

  <p>
  <li>Win32 applications that install blocking hooks. <i>Grossly
  lame.</i><br><br>

  Reason: Besides yielding to other applications (<a href="#item17">see
  item 17</a>), blocking hook functions were originally designed to
  allow concurrent processing within a task while there was a blocking
  operation pending. In Win32, there&rsquo;s threading.<br><br>

  Alternative: Use threads.

  <p>
  <li>Polling with <code>ioctlsocket(FIONREAD)</code> on a stream socket
  until a complete "message" arrives. <i>Exceeds the bounds of earthly
  lameness.</i><br><br>

  Reason and Alternative: <a href="#item12">See item 12</a>.

  <p>
  <li>Assuming that a UDP datagram of any length may be
  sent. <i>Criminally lame.</i><br><br>

  Reason: Various networks all have their limitations on maximum
  transmission unit (MTU). As a result, fragmentation will occur,
  and this increases the likelihood of a corrupted datagram (more
  pieces to lose or corrupt). Also, the TCP/IP service providers
  at the receiving end may not be capable of re-assembling a large,
  fragmented datagram.<br><br>

  Alternative: Check for the maximum datagram size with the
  <code>SO_MAX_MSG_SIZE</code> socket option, and don&rsquo;t send
  anything larger. Better yet, be even more conservative. A max of
  8K is a good rule-of-thumb.

  <p>
  <li>Assuming the UDP transmissions (especially multicast
  transmissions) are reliable. <i>Sinking in a morass of
  lameness.</i><br><br>

  Reason: UDP has no reliability mechanisms (that&rsquo;s why we
  have TCP).<br><br>

  Alternative: Use TCP and keep track of your own message boundaries.

  <p>
  <li>Applications that require vendor-specific extensions, and cannot
  run (or worse yet, load) without them. <i>Stooping to unspeakable
  depths of lameness.</i><br><br>

  Reason: If you can&rsquo;t figure out the reason, it&rsquo;s time
  to hang up your keyboard.<br><br>

  Alternative: Have a fallback position that uses only base
  capabilities for when the extension functions are not present.

  <p>
  <li>Expecting errors when UDP datagrams are dropped by the sender,
  receiver, or any router along the way. <i>Seeping lameness from
  every crack and crevice.</i><br><br>

  Reason: UDP is unreliable. TCP/IP stacks don&rsquo;t have to tell
  you when they throw your datagrams away (a sender or receiver may
  do this when they don&rsquo;t have buffer space available, and a
  receiver will do it if they cannot reassemble a large fragmented
  datagram.<br><br>

  Alternative: Expect to lose datagrams, and deal. Implement
  reliability in your application protocol, if you need it (or use TCP,
  if your application allows it).<br><br>
