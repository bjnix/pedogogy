<h3>Winsock for Non-Windows Systems</h3>

<p><i>by Warren Young</i></p>

<p>This FAQ is about using Winsock, with the focus of using
<a href="../general.html#version">Winsock on Windows</a>. However,
networking is inherently multiplatform, so many people writing Winsock
programs also need to write programs for another platform. This article
is about Winsock work-alikes on other platforms, and the alternatives
to Winsock on these platforms.</p>

<p>Before I begin, I want to point out that the Winsock API depends
greatly on Windows' messaging, DLL, and I/O mechanisms. All of the
Winsock work-alikes mentioned below have limitations with respect
to Winsock. Most of the solutions below are a subset of Winsock,
and others manage to emulate Windows mechanisms, with an associated
speed hit.</p>


<h4>DOS</h4>

<h5>Windows Console Mode</h5>

<p>Before I discuss alternatives to Winsock for DOS programmers, I want
to clear up a common confusion. Command-line windows under
<a href="../intro.html#versions">modern</a> versions of Windows are
sometimes called &ldquo;DOS boxes.&rdquo; This is a historical term, and
is now inaccurate. Modern Windows supports a class of programs called
&ldquo;console mode programs.&rdquo; Such programs run in these
&ldquo;DOS boxes&rdquo; and can look and feel like old DOS programs, but
they can call any Windows API function, including Winsock. Note for
example that most of the <a href="../examples/index.html">FAQ&rsquo;s examples</a>
are console programs.</p>

<p>If you have a choice, I urge you to use real Winsock in a console
mode program rather than one of the truly DOS-based alternatives that
follow. The only ways I can think of that this is not possible is that
you are either building a system that boots purely into DOS with no
Windows at all, or that you are somehow stuck running DOS box programs
under Windows 3.1. (Poor souls!)</p>

<h5>Real DOS Alternatives</h5>

<p>Still not deterred? Okay, you have several options.</p>

<p>Your first stop should probably be Richard Dawe&rsquo;s <a
href="http://rich.phekda.org/richdawe/dossock/">dossock Mailing List</a>
page. There are many useful-looking resources here.</p>

<p>I have personal experience with only one of the options mentioned on
that page, Erick Engelke&rsquo;s <a
href="http://www.erickengelke.com/wattcp/">Waterloo TCP</a> package.
This is a freeware TCP/IP stack that runs under DOS. I used this library
myself years ago, and it works very well. The only problem I have with
it is that its API is nothing like BSD sockets, which makes for more of
a learning curve than is strictly necessary. The library itself is free
to use, but they charge you if you want a programmer&rsquo;s manual.  If
you plan on using this package to develop serious applications, trust
me, this is a worthwhile investment. (If you&rsquo;re just puttering
around, you can probably figure things out by spending lots of time
messing around with the example programs.)</a>

<p>There is an extended version of WatTCP called <a
href="http://home.broadpark.no/~gvanem/">Watt-32</a>. Among other
things, this adds support for 32-bit protected mode DOS and a BSD
sockets API. I haven&rsquo;t used this version, so I can&rsquo;t comment
further on it.</p>

<p>There used to be several commercial BSD sockets libraries for DOS.
I&rsquo;m not aware of any that are still available, alas.</p>

<p>WatTCP uses <a href="http://www.crynwr.com/">Crynwr</a> packet
drivers to access your network card. Becuase of this, you can&rsquo;t
run these stacks under Windows NT derivatives, and it requires jumping
through some hoops to make them run under Windows 95 derivatives.</p>

<p>One final method I&rsquo;ve found that looks interesting enough to
call out by name is <a
href="http://www.trumpet.com.au/index.php/products/4-products/5-dos-tcpip-driver.html">offered</a>
by <a href="http://www.trumpet.com.au/">Tattam Software Enterprises</a>.
These are the same folk behind Trumpet Winsock, which was at one time
one of the more popular third-party implementations of Winsock for
Windows 3.<i>x</i> systems.</p>


<h4>Unix</h4>

<p>All modern Unixes offer BSD sockets, the ancestor of Winsock. All of
the calls not beginning with &ldquo;WSA&rdquo; are in BSD sockets,
either directly or with some small name change. See <a
href="bsd-compatibility.html">this FAQ article</a> for details.</p>

<p>Older versions of System V Unix had a competing API called XTI.
(Also called TLI in its older form). XTI is similar enough to Winsock
and BSD sockets that you won&rsquo;t have much trouble learning it if
you know the sockets API, but you should only use it if BSD sockets
are unavailable or broken on your system. XTI is a dead API.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also the <a href="http://www.winehq.com/">WINE</a>
option. WINE is a clean-room reimplementation of the Windows API for
Unix/Linux including Winsock support. Years ago when I looked at this,
they hadn&rsquo;t gotten around to finishing their Winsock 2 support,
but I expect that this has changed. I tried to verify it, but
couldn&rsquo;t find the tables showing the implementation status for the
various parts of the Windows API. If anyone can point me to such
resources, <a href="/email/">drop me a line</a>.</p>


<h4>Mac OS and iOS</h4>

<p>OS X is based on BSD Unix, so naturally it has BSD sockets
support.</p>

<p>iOS, being based on OS X, also supports BSD sockets.</p>

<p>The original stack for MacOS was called MacTCP, which first came out
for System 6 (?) back in 1988. It was replaced in 1995 with Open
Transport, which first shipped with System 7.5.2 and was available
through Mac OS 9. Neither API is BSD-compatible, though since both were
built to support TCP/IP, the concepts should transfer reasonably
well.</p>


<h4>Palm OS and webOS</h4>

<p>The modern &ldquo;Palm&rdquo; OS is webOS, which is based on browsewr
technologies. The nearest thing to Winsock you would expect to see in
such a platform is <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Sockets">WebSockets</a>, which
were not yet supported on webOS the last I checked. Lacking such
support, the best you can do is use web protocols like HTTP and FTP.</p>

<p>webOS does have a Plug-in Development Kit which supports both BSD
Sockets and a higher-level wrapper API. It means you have to write in
C/C++ instead of JavaScript, however.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;classic&rdquo; Palm OS had a native network library that
used different function names from BSD sockets, but newer SDKs have a
wrapper that lets you use plain old sockets calls. Most of these are
#defines in the SDK file Core/System/Unix/sys_socket.h. There are a few
other calls (e.g., <code>select()</code>) that are implemented in a glue
function. If you&rsquo;re using the PRC-Tools toolchain, you get this in
your program by linking with the libNetSocket.a library.</p>


<h4>NetWare</h4>

<p>NetWare has had Winsock support since September of 1998. It&rsquo;s
included in NetWare 5, and can be had for NetWare 4 in Support
Pack 8.</p>


<h4>OS/2</h4>

<p>As of OS/2 Warp 4, OS/2 supports Winsock as well as its own sockets
API. The Winsock emulation is part of OS/2&rsquo;s Open32 API.
OS/2&rsquo;s native sockets API is based on pure Berkeley sockets.  In a
sense, then, you can have a subset of Winsock without using the Open32
API. You mainly lose all the functions that begin with
&ldquo;WSA.&rdquo;</p>

<p>OS/2 Warp 3.0 and earlier have extra-cost packages available that
add TCP/IP support, including some support for the Winsock API.</p>
