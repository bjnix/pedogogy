<h2>The History of Winsock</h2>

<p><i>by Warren Young</i></p>

<p>This article was started in late 2009 when I refocused the FAQ
on Windows NT 4.0 SP4 and newer. The FAQ had a lot of material for
older systems in it, and rather than just axe it all, I decided
to use it as a seed for a new article. The idea was to present all
that information in historical context, to explain why Winsock was
different in those days. It also explains a lot about why Winsock is
the way it is today.</p>

<p>To properly explain such things, I found myself needing to give a
lot of back-story that isn&rsquo;t strictly about Winsock, but which
nevertheless informed the design of the early Winsock implementations.
Taken together, this is the story of the rise of Winsock and TCP/IP
against the spate of proprietary networking schemes prevalant at
the time.</p>

<p>With that history to ground us, the <a href="#part2">second part</a>
presents the technical differences and limitations in those old stacks
relative to the <a href="../intro.html#versions">modern</a> ones covered
in the FAQ proper. All of the limitations and bugs discussed here are
in products released over a decade ago, and thus of little interest
to working programmers, except as history.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is the very <a href="../history.html">age</a> of this FAQ
that justifies the inclusion of a history article. History works like
a lens: you can use it to create a picture that condenses a lot of
activity into a thing small enough to speak its message clearly. The
thing is, like a photographic lens, the lens of history also has a
minimum focal distance: when you try to focus it on events that are
still too close, you end up with a blurry confusion that won&rsquo;t
enlighten anyone. For technology, that minimum focusing distance is
about a decade.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not interested in the history or lived through
it like I did and aren&rsquo;t interested in someone else&rsquo;s
recounting of it, feel free to skip ahead to that second part.</p>


<a name="part1"></a>
<h3>Part 1: The Rise of Vendor-Neutral Networking</h3>

<p>In the beginning, there was chaos.</p>

<p>Throughout the 1980s and into the early
1990s, there was little of the broad agreement on
networking standards that we have today. Microsoft had <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN_Manager">LAN Manager</a>,
but it wasn&rsquo;t even close to dominant. It competed with a zoo of
other proprietary systems from Novell, IBM, 3Com, and other companies
long since dead or unrecognizably morphed. Generally speaking, back
in the DOS and early Windows eras, you bought your desktop operating
system from Microsoft and your network stack from some third party,
usually selected based on whose servers you were using  <a href="#FN1" name="FR1"><span class="footnote">1</span></a>.</p>


<h3>Networking Support in Early Windows<br />
<font size="2">(Or Rather, the Lack Thereof)</font></h3>

<p>Early networking hardware was not only proprietary and nonstandard,
it was usually quite expensive to boot. I remember it being a
big deal when network interface cards first started dropping below
$1,000.</p>

<p>Because of this, the early PCs had no built-in support for
networking. A programmer wanting to build a program that talked to
the network either had to write his own network card drivers and
protocol stack, or buy these programs from someone who had already
written them.</p>

<p>Microsoft was trying to solve these sorts of problems in Windows,
which abstracted away hardware details with its driver mechanism. They
did a really good job with some classes of hardware. A Windows
programmer has little need to worry about the particular chips in the
computer, or the peripherals attached to it. A DOS programmer wanting
to targer a broad user base had to implement half a dozen different
mouse protocols, for instance. Video cards were an even worse mess,
and printers worse still. Windows presented a unified interface to
all this hardware and more.</p>

<p>But until 1993, the broad hardware support in Windows did not
extend to network cards. Why?</p>

<p>Microsoft had poor incentives to solve the networking problem
in Windows. Their primary incentive through the early 1990s was
to continue flogging their own horse in this race, LAN Manager. It
was a DOS product, but then, its biggest competitors didn&rsquo;t
run on Windows, either: NetWare was built on top of Novell&rsquo;s
own proprietary OS, IBM&rsquo;s LAN Server product ran atop OS/2,
Banyan VINES atop a custom version of Unix... The LAN Manager
technology wasn&rsquo;t added to Windows until 1993, in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_for_Workgroups">Windows
for Workgroups</a> 3.1 and Windows NT 3.1.</p>


<h4>The Battle for the LAN</h4>

<p>Thus was the dominance of proprietary networking schemes
prolonged.</p>

<p>Understand, Microsoft <i>was</i> trying to move people off of
DOS and off of competing file and print services, but in typical
Microsoft fashion, their first solution to the problem was weak and
late. In part, Microsoft was competing against themselves. The DOS LAN
Manager stack ran just fine underneath regular Windows 3.1, which had a
year&rsquo;s sales lead. Moving away from this required replacing both
your client and server operating systems with more expensive versions,
with little net gain in the end. It would take years for regular PC
replacement cycles to diffuse these Windows implementations of the
LAN Manager technology into the PC world to an extent that network
managers felt they could start switching to it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Microsoft was also fighting against the inertia possessed
by all their other competitors for dominance of the LAN. Moving off
NetWare or VINES or whatever was no easy jump.</p>

<p>One by one, these competitors fell. By 1993, there was only one
left worth talking about, Novell&rsquo;s NetWare.</p>

<p>The reader may not be old enough to have lived through this battle
between Microsoft and Novell over control of the LAN. Simply recall
the same noise, confusion and hyperbole of any other major technology
battle you have lived through: Netscape vs. Internet Explorer,
iPhone vs. the world cell phone system, Google vs. everybody...
The battle for control of the LAN was every bit as significant at
the time. There were magazine covers about it. Really!</p>

<p>As in so many other such battles, the bone of contention was
the tempting possibility of vendor lock-in through proprietary
technologies.  Whoever controlled the winning technology would control
the LAN. (So they thought at the time, anyway.)</p>


<h4>First Moves Toward Portable, Ubiquitous Networking</h4>

<p>Above, I&rsquo;ve been pretty hard on Microsoft, painting them as only
interested in control through proprietary technology. Someone more
charitable might instead observe that with all the confusion in the
networking market of the time, it wasn&rsquo;t as clear what it might
mean to have a vendor-neutral network programming API as it was for,
say, sound cards.</p>

<p>I would say it&rsquo;s not charity I lack, but credulousness,
because the problem had been solved a decade earlier in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4.2BSD">4.2BSD</a>. This was the
first appearance of &ldquo;sockets,&rdquo; one of many BSD innovations
to fix shortcomings in the original Unix. 4.2BSD also saw the first
implementation of TCP/IP and is why sockets were created to begin
with.</p>

<p>These BSD innovations were well known to many third-party Windows
software developers. This created a market for TCP/IP stacks for
Windows, which was small but thriving all this time Microsoft was
focused elsewhere.</p>

<p>The third-party stack vendors had already created their own
proprietary technology mess, however, each vendor providing a
different programming API. A group of these vendors got together with
Microsoft and hammered out a backwards-compatible extension of the
sockets API, which they called WinSock  <a href="#FN2" name="FR2"><span class="footnote">2</span></a>, short for Windows
Sockets. Version 1.0 of the spec came out in the summer of 1992. Half
a year later, version 1.1 introduced several minor improvements and
clarifications.</p>

<p>Winsock 1.1 was a truly landmark API, important for many years
after, and arguably still important today. With it, programmers finally
had an alternative to proprietary network APIs on Windows. You still
had to buy a third-party stack, but at least you weren&rsquo;t tied
to that one vendor&rsquo;s stack.</p>

<p>Although the creation of Winsock and the Windowsization of
LAN Manager were both happening at the same time, they were
not part of a single unified Microsoft strategy. The driver
behind these contemporaneous events was the falling price of LAN
equipment. Microsoft frequently has multiple initiatives going at any
one time that compete with each other, simply because they are a huge
company with a hugely diverse customer base and thus diverse draws for
their attention. Microsoft was seeing pressure from those interested in
vendor-neutral networking, and responded with Winsock.  Meantime, their
main focus remained on the battle with Novell. Microsoft didn&rsquo;t
release a product including Winsock for years past the initial spec,
and even then it only appeared in their business-focused editions of
Windows. The early years of Winsock were largely a way for Microsoft to
help developers using third-party network products interoperate with
each other. If you wanted to use Microsoft&rsquo;s own technology,
though, you still had to use their proprietary APIs.</p>


<h4>The Long, Slow Rise of TCP/IP and Winsock</h4>

<p>The high cost of replacing infrastructure and the high reliance
of networking on infrastructure mean adoption of new networking
technology takes longer than just about anything else in the PC
industry. Companies offering clearly better technology often go out of
business before they can sell enough product to pay off their R&amp;D
costs. Sure, network speeds increase right in line with Moore&rsquo;s
Law, but replacing anything down at the infrastructure level, including
APIs, takes years.</p>

<p>In this time when Microsoft and Novell were duking it out over
proprietary LAN technologies and the third-party Winsock stack
market was prospering, TCP/IP was this weird thing that was mostly
used by minicomputers and expensive workstations running Unix. It
was the technological glue that held together this equally strange
thing called the <i>Internet</i> that few businesses and almost
no individual users had used yet, if they&rsquo;d heard of it at
all. The rise of TCP/IP and the Internet was so peripheral to the
main PC industry that Microsoft almost completely ignored it until
the second half of the 1990s.</p>

<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s first OS release including a Winsock-based stack
was Windows NT 3.1, which came out in mid-1993, a year after the first
Winsock spec. This first version of Windows NT wasn&rsquo;t received
well at all. Even in the best possible scenario, NT could never have
commanded enough market share to worry Novell and the third-party
Winsock stack vendors, being too resource-hungry to run well on
consumer-class hardware and too expensive to run on anything but big
servers besides. As Microsoft themselves have proven repeatedly,
he who owns the consumer market will always outcompete anyone who
shuns it.</p>

<a name="wolverine"></a>
<p>Microsoft didn&rsquo;t make a second grab at this market until 1994,
when they released a free Winsock-based TCP/IP stack as an add-on to
Windows for Workgroups, which was only ever called by its codename,
Wolverine  <a href="#FN3" name="FR3"><span class="footnote">3</span></a>. It didn&rsquo;t work with regular Windows 3.1
at all, and it was something you had to go and download from Microsoft,
so again it didn&rsquo;t exactly catapult Microsoft into the lead. The
old LAN Manager technology was gaining ground against the likes of
Novell and IBM by this time thanks to the rise of Windows NT and the
death of DOS, but Winsock and TCP/IP were still a specialty thing,
something most people relied on a third party to provide.</p>

<p>And so it was that those third party Winsock vendors, all vanished
or transmogrified beyond recognition today, prospered for several
years after Winsock was created. Programs written and tested on one
vendor&rsquo;s Winsock stack generally worked fine when run on a
different computer using a different stack. There was the occasional
interop problem, of course, but in general the vision of a vendor-
and protocol-neutral network programming API worked out exactly
as intended.</p>

<p>Doom finally came to this market three years after Winsock was
created, with the release of Windows 95. This was the first consumer
OS from Microsoft with networking included. Not only did it include
Microsoft&rsquo;s own proprietary NetBIOS based networking scheme,
but also TCP/IP, the language of the Internet, which was taking off
with the commercialization of the Internet at the same time. The
inertia produced by the highly successful Windows 3.1 still kept the
third-party stack vendor market alive for years afterward, but by the
time of the last Winsock specification two years after the release
of Windows 95, the new shape of the world was clear.</p>

<p>In 1996, Microsoft drove another big nail into the third party
Winsock stack market&rsquo;s coffin lid, releasing Windows NT 4. It
included Winsock 2, substantially the same API as in current versions
of Windows. Later tweaks to the spec, taking it up to version 2.2.2,
came in the form of service packs to NT. When Microsoft released
the last Winsock spec in 1997, it wasn&rsquo;t because the stacks in
Windows stopped changing, but because there was no longer a need for a
separate spec, there being no third-party market left to speak of. It
took many years more to kill off the zombie armies of Token Ring and
IPX machines &mdash; again, infrastructure changes take time &mdash;
but by 1997 it was fair to say that the Winsock specification was
&ldquo;whatever Windows stacks do today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If another nail was needed, 1997 also saw a version of
Internet Explorer 4 for 16-bit Windows that included a full
Winsock-based network stack. You can still download it <a
href="http://browsers.evolt.org/?ie/win16">here</a>, if you&rsquo;re
interested.</p>


<h4>So What Happened?</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s fixed in computing industry lore now that
&ldquo;Microsoft was late to the Internet.&rdquo; Bill Gates as
much as admitted this in the scramble to update his ill-timed book
<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_Ahead">The Road
Ahead</a></i>. (The linked article has a good summary of the events
I refer to, <i>[citations needed]</i> notwithstanding.)</p>

<p>The Internet took off in 1994. Many of the most significant
Internet organizations were founded that year: Amazon.com, Yahoo!,
Netscape, the W3C... This was the year it became clear to everyone
that there was money to be made here. Doubtless even Microsoft saw
this, internally, but Microsoft is a big ship to turn.</p>

<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet access story
in 1994 was all but nonexistent. There was no <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up_networking">DUN</a> feature
in Windows; you had to buy third-party software to get that.  Internet
Explorer didn&rsquo;t exist yet; it would take until late summer of
1995 for that to appear, as part of Windows 95, and it didn&rsquo;t
become a solid browser until a year later, with Internet Explorer
3. You couldn&rsquo;t even plug a stock Windows 3.1 box into a LAN
and get access to the Internet through a LAN gateway to the Internet;
you had to buy a separate stack or upgrade to Windows for Workgroups
so you could use Microsoft&rsquo;s experimental Wolverine stack.</p>

<p>A great many of us on the Internet in those early days therefore
didn&rsquo;t use Winsock or TCP/IP. The hoi polloi used proprietary
systems like AOL, and the geeks used Unix boxes or terminal software
to get dial-up access to one. This was a year of transition, the bend
in the hockey stick curve of Internet adoption. So, all through this
year, the Microsoft vs. Novell story still mattered, but it was all
about to be obliterated.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s foolish to nail down a single cause to an event, but it
seems to be a thing historians must do, so here&rsquo;s where I draw
my arbitrary line in the sand: Novell lost the battle for the LAN
not to Microsoft, but to the Internet.  Both companies had products
that defined the way people got access to networked resources, but
like anything that depends on central control, it was doomed to fail,
unable to scale.</p>

<p>Both companies&rsquo; proprietary protocols were destroyed by
a third, TCP/IP. It was controlled by no one, and thus was no
threat they could identify. Novell&rsquo;s unrouteable IPX/SPX
is inconsequential in today&rsquo;s world where virtually every
computer is part of a WAN, the Internet if nothing else. The original
protocol underlying Microsoft&rsquo;s LAN Manager technology,
NetBEUI, was similarly unrouteable and thus also unable to move into
the WAN world, though they did manage to patch over the problem by
moving to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBT">NetBIOS over
TCP/IP</a>.  <a href="#FN4" name="FR4"><span class="footnote">4</span></a></p>

<p>Although the Microsoft file and print sharing technologies
live on in a way that the Novell ones do not, they&rsquo;re
hopelessly commoditized, available in every NAS box and all their
competitors&rsquo; operating systems, such that no one makes a serious
buck off control of these any more. When you go to share a file, it
almost certainly goes over TCP/IP, and the chance that the high-level
transfer protocol is SMB and not some Internet protocol &mdash; FTP,
SMTP, HTTP, BitTorrent, chat &mdash; are increasingly small. To the
extent that we still print documents any more in the age of widespread
Internet publishing and cloud word processors, it, too, almost always
uses TCP/IP and frequently uses Internet protocols like IPP.</p>

<p>Old technologies rarely go away entirely: many still listen to
AM radio and write with fountain pens. Yet, it&rsquo;s clear that
Microsoft lost the battle for the LAN through control of file and print
services. The battle moved away from the LAN to the WANnest WAN of them
all, the Internet, where overall control is virtually impossible.</p>

<p>And yet, did they really lose? When Windows 95 came out with TCP/IP
and Winsock built in, it immediately killed off the third-party
stack market. They saved themselves again against another rising
competitor, Netscape, a few years later. Today, the new challenger
is cloud computing: the buzz is all about Google, Amazon S3, Linux,
and social networking. Microsoft continues to join the party late,
but they still hold commanding shares in many network related areas.
This drags us back on-point, finally: Winsock is still relevant.</p>


<a name="part2"></a>
<h3>Part 2: Using Winsock in the Early Days</h3>

<p>These early third-party Winsock stacks collectively supported all
the popular network protocols of the time, not just TCP/IP, the most
popular use of Winsock today.</p>

<p>The way this worked is that each vendor wrote a DLL &mdash;
simply called <tt>winsock.dll</tt> on 16-bit Windows &mdash; which
knew how to translate standard Winsock calls into the form needed
by the associated network stack. The DLL was just one of the things
you got when you installed the stack  <a href="#FN5" name="FR5"><span class="footnote">5</span></a>. The stack vendor
also gave you an import library and a <tt>winsock.h</tt> header
to compile against  <a href="#FN6" name="FR6"><span class="footnote">6</span></a>. Once built, you could install your
program on any computer providing a Winsock DLL and expect it to at
least run. Naturally, it would only work if the computer&rsquo;s stack
supported the right protocols. You couldn&rsquo;t expect to write a
Winsock program speaking IPX, built and tested against Novell&rsquo;s
Winsock, to run on, say, NetManage&rsquo;s TCP/IP Winsock stack. But,
your program <i>would</i> run, giving error messages indicating the
problem, not crash or fail to even start.</p>

<p>Another hurdle of the time is that there were subtle differences in
Windows NT 3.<i>x</i>&rsquo;s 32-bit version of Winsock relative to the
more popular third-party implementations for 16-bit Windows. Because
of these differences, the 32-bit DLL was called <tt>wsock32.dll</tt>,
which you can still find on the most recent release of Windows,
providing the good old Winsock 1.1 API. You can still write new
programs against this API, and they&rsquo;ll work fine if all
you need is Winsock 1.1 support.  Windows NT also included a
<tt>winsock.dll</tt> for compatibility with 16-bit programs, of
course. I still see a <tt>winsock.dll</tt> on an XP system I have
here.</p>

<p>Conversely, there was an add-on from Microsoft you could download
for 16-bit Windows called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win32s">Win32s</a>, a 32-bit emulation layer,
which included a <tt>wsock32.dll</tt>. I used it for a while back
when Windows 3.1 was still common. As long as you stuck to a rather
small subset of the Win32 API, you could write, build and test your
program on Windows NT 3.51 &mdash; so much less stressful to use than
Windows 95! &mdash; and deploy the unmodified binaries on Windows
3.1. Ah, memories.</p>


<h4>Networking Limitations in Old Versions of Windows</h4>

<p>Although Windows 95, 98, and ME support a large portion of
the full Win32 API defined for Windows NT and its derivatives
&mdash; Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 200<i>x</i>,
Windows Vista, and Windows 7 &mdash; these operating systems are
closer in technical capability to Windows 3.1 than to NT. They <a
href="http://oreilly.com/centers/windows/brochure/isnot.html">share its
reliance on DOS</a>, and in other ways are not fully top-to-bottom
integrated 32-bit operating systems like Windows NT and its
descendants. They also have a lot of arbitrary limitations lower than
the corresponding limit in NT.</p>

<p>In this section, I will discuss those limitations that affect
Winsock programs. You can readily find information elsewhere about
broader platform issues.</p>

<p>Frequently below it&rsquo;s helpful to group several releases
of Windows based on some common capability. &ldquo;DOS-based&rdquo;
obviously refers to the old 16-bit versions of Windows, but also to
Windows 95 and its direct descendants. Where we wish to talk only about
the 32-bit DOS-based versions of Windows &mdash; Windows 95, 98 and
ME &mdash; we&rsquo;ll refer to them as &ldquo;Chicago kernel&rdquo;
operating systems, after the code name for Windows 95. Finally,
in a few places we cover some of the earlier NT derivatives, either
specifically or as a dividing point in history.</p>


<h5>I/O Overhead</h5>

<p>The most serious disadvantage is that the Chicago kernels
don&rsquo;t support overlapped I/O or I/O Completion Ports. These
mechanisms provide lower overhead I/O in NT derivatives, as compared
to more traditional forms of I/O.</p>

<p>In the first versions of NT, overlapped I/O only worked with some
forms of I/O, like disk storage. Windows NT 4 extended the Winsock
API to allow use of overlapped I/O with networking, too.</p>

<p>Windows 98 came out not long after NT 4, so it also had Winsock 2,
but since there is no underlying kernel support for overlapped I/O,
it&rsquo;s emulated in user space so there is no speed advantage over
traditional <a href="../articles/io-strategies.html">I/O strategies</a>. Windows ME
shares this limitation.</p>


<h5>Error Messages</h5>

<p>In Windows 2000, Microsoft enhanced the Win32 API <code>FormatMessage()</code>
so it would accept Winsock error codes, giving decent <a
href="../newbie.html#errmsg">canned error messages</a>. In earlier
NT derivatives and all DOS-based versions of Windows, programmers had to
build error code to message mapping mechanisms themselves, such as with
a STRINGTABLE in the resource file.</p>


<h5>Nonblocking Socket Signaling</h5>

<p>Winsock on Chicago systems has a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/177346">bug</a> where
<code>select()</code> can fail to block on a nonblocking socket. It will
signal one of the sockets, which will cause your program to call
<code>recv()</code> or <code>send()</code> or similar. That function will return
<code>WSAEWOULDBLOCK</code>, which can be quite a surprise. So,
a program using <code>select()</code> on Chicago systems has to be able to
deal with this error at any time.</p>


<h5>Setting Up a Dummy Network for Testing</h5>

<p>On modern Windows, if you have a network interface, the default
network configuration also adds a loopback interface so that two
programs can talk to each other within the machine. This means you can
test network programs without a second machine to bounce packets off
of. Even if you don&rsquo;t have a network interface in the machine,
you can add a dummy loopback device easily.</p>

<p>Getting to the same point was often surprisingly difficult on
DOS-based Windows, since the more primitive stacks you tended to
see on them were often so very vertically integrated that they made
unwarranted assumptions about the way the network should work, making
uncommon usages like loopback testing difficult.</p>

<a name="dunautodial"></a>
<p>An example: One of the easiest ways to get a loopback interface
for testing on Chicago systems was to install Dial Up Networking
(DUN) and point it at an unused serial port. The main problem you
then encountered is that DUN would blindly decide to dial the modem
any time you do a name lookup call like <code>gethostbyname()</code>, even
when it should have been obvious to the stack that this couldn&rsquo;t
succeed. The Chigago DUN system was so stupid about this that on a
system with both a modem and a LAN card, and DNS configured on the
LAN interface, it would still try to dial the modem for a DNS lookup
that the local DNS server knew how to answer. The best workaround was
simply to turn off DUN&rsquo;s automatic dial feature, and to be sure
only to use IP addresses in testing, not domain names.</p>


<h5>Keepalives</h5>

<p>One of the features of the TCP protocol is the ability
to periodically send an empty packet to the other side. The
remote program won&rsquo;t see anything, but it tells the remote
peer&rsquo;s stack that we&rsquo;re still here. These packets are
called &ldquo;keepalives&rdquo; since they&rsquo;re used to oppose code
in some network stacks that drops a network link if nothing happens on
it for some time. This is common with modem PPP links, for instance. A
side effect of keepalives is that it can be used to detect when the
link has gone down with network media that doesn&rsquo;t have a way
to signal the remote peer&rsquo;s disconnection, like Ethernet.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in all Microsoft stacks for DOS-based versions of
Windows and in Windows NT through version 4, you couldn&rsquo;t set
this timeout period on a per-process basis. You could set a registry
entry to change it for the entire system, but the varying ways
keepalives are used mean that earlier versions of this FAQ simply
recommended against using them. With Windows 2000 or better finally
being something most programs can count on, the FAQ has flipped
a 180.</p>


<h5>No SSL or TLS</h5>

<p>Microsoft added generic SSL/TLS support to Windows NT, but on the
DOS-based OSes, you had to fall back to one of a few less palatable
options. If all you needed was HTTP, you could piggyback on the
Internet Explorer engine, which limited your program&rsquo;s range of
capability to that of IE itself. (You probably wouldn&rsquo;t want
to write a custom Web spider this way, for instance.) If you needed
some other protocol or needed full control of the HTTP conversation,
you had to either write your own SSL/TLS support, or get it from some
<a href="../resources/libraries.html">third-party library</a>.</p>

<h5>Incomplete WSAIoctl Support</h5>

<p>The new <code>WSAIoctl()</code> function in Winsock 2 adds a lot of
useful functionality, but it wasn&rsquo;t completely implemented in
Winsock 2 for non-<a href="../intro.html#versions">modern</a> versions
of Windows.</p>

<p>Take the <tt>SIO_GET_INTERFACE_LIST</tt> sub-function, for example.
It completely fails on Windows 95, even after installing the Winsock
2 add-ons. On Windows 98, it returns only partial information. And
on Windows NT 4.0 with SP3 and earlier, there are known bugs.
(<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/181520">KB181520</a> and <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/170642">KB170642</a>) In all cases, the fix is to
upgrade to a modern version of Windows.</p>


<a name="hostsfile"></a>
<h5>Location of HOSTS and SERVICES Files</h5>

<p>In DOS-based versions of Windows, these files were tossed in the <a
href="http://www.cookingdebauchery.com/cooking_debauchery/2006/03/garbage_stew.html">garbage
stew</a> that is <tt>C:\WINDOWS</tt>. In NT and its descendants,
they were moved to the Unix-inspired <tt>%WINSYSDIR%\drivers\etc</tt>
directory.</p>


<a name="msgqueues"></a>
<h5>Asynchronous Notification and Message Queue Length</h5>

<p>Win16 message queues are fixed-length and fairly short, so it is at
least possible to lose <code>WSAAsyncSelect()</code> notifications in 16-bit
programs. If Winsock fails to send you a notification because the
message queue is full, it is supposed to keep trying, but empirical
evidence suggests that this does not always happen. It&rsquo;s hard to
be specific here due to the nature of &ldquo;16-bit Winsock,&rdquo;
since this is back when we had all the confusion that competition
brings. We&rsquo;re talking about stacks from a dozen different
vendors, each with many versions, spanning many years.</p>


<a name="servers"></a>
<h5>No Good as Servers</h5>

<p>The DOS-based versions of Windows are completely unsuitable for
use as servers, for a number of reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>They share the 5-slot backlog limit of the
  workstation-class Windows NT derivatives.</p></li>

  <li><p>The performance of their stacks are objectively inferior
  to those in the NT derivatives. Simple tests to show this
  are timing the connection accept time and throughput of a
  single connection. It gets worse as the number of concurrent
  connections goes up.</p></li>

  <li><p>Their kernels are much less stable.</p></li>

  <li><p>Their kernels lack overlapped I/O support. (It&rsquo;s
  emulated out in user space.)</p></li>

  <li><p>I/O completion ports are completely missing.</p></li>

  <li><p>The networking subsystem doesn&rsquo;t handle multiple
  network cards very well.</p></li>
</ol>


<a name="rawsockets"></a>
<h5>Raw Sockets</h5>

<p>The DOS-based versions of Windows with Winsock 2 support only
allow you to send ICMP and IGMP over raw sockets. This lets programs
<a href="../examples/rawping.html">send &ldquo;ping&rdquo; packets</a> in a
standard way, and little else.</p>

<p>Some of the third-party Winsock 1.1 stacks also supported raw
sockets, but since the Winsock 1.1 spec didn&rsquo;t standardize raw
sockets, everyone did it differently.</p>


<a name="100sockets"></a>
<h5>Only 100 Sockets</h5>

<p>On Windows 95 derivatives, a process can only have
100 connections, a limit enforced by the kernel. You
can increase this limit by editing the registry key
<tt>HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\MSTCP\MaxConnections</tt>.
On Windows 95, the key is a DWORD; on Windows 98/ME, it&rsquo;s a
STRING. I&rsquo;ve seen some reports of instability when this value
is increased to more than a few times its default value.</p>


<a name="inheritance"></a>
<h5>Cross-Process Socket Inheritance</h5>

<p>Modern Windows systems let a process share socket and other file
handles with other processes. This mechanism is broken in Chicago
kernel OSes. See Microsoft knowledge base articles <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/150523">KB150523</a>
and <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/156319">KB156319</a> for details.</p>


<a name="selectblock"></a>
<h5>select() Fails to Block on a Blocking Socket</h5>

<p>There&rsquo;s a bug in Chicago-kernel versions of Windows where
<code>select()</code> doesn&rsquo;t behave as you might expect. The details
are in Microsoft knowledge base article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/177346">KB177346</a>. Though it
really is a bug, this is one of those areas where defensive programming
is a better answer than upgrading the OS.</p>

<h5>Footnotes</h5>

<ol class="small">
  <li><p>Remember, Microsoft didn&rsquo;t have a server operating
  system at the time. You can&rsquo;t count Xenix, because Microsoft
  didn&rsquo;t sell it directly, and Microsoft Xenix didn&rsquo;t
  have networking in it anyway. SCO added TCP/IP support to their
  variant of Xenix shortly before Microsoft gave control of Xenix
  over to SCO.  &nbsp;<a href="#FR1" name="FN1">&uarr;</a></p></li>

  <li><p>Only pedants still use the original camel-case
  spelling.  &nbsp;<a href="#FR2" name="FN2">&uarr;</a></p></li>

  <li><p>I was stunned to learn that
  you can still download the Wolverine stack, <a
  href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/peropsys/windows/public/tcpip/WFWT32.EXE">here</a>,
  at least as of early 2010.  Talk about backwards
  compatibility!  &nbsp;<a href="#FR3" name="FN3">&uarr;</a></p></li>

  <li><p>Even today, with fast WANs and improved protocols, you
  often still find Windows file and print services blocked at the
  LAN gateway, or at least greatly restricted.  &nbsp;<a href="#FR4" name="FN4">&uarr;</a></p></li>

  <li><p>This lead to a common newbie mistake in the old days of
  Winsock, where someone would try to copy a <tt>winsock.dll</tt> file
  from one machine to another, or include it with their program&rsquo;s
  installer. Their program would fail to even start because the
  stack-specific DLL couldn&rsquo;t find the underlying stack it
  needed to function. These days it&rsquo;s part of the operating
  system, so we don&rsquo;t have to worry about distribution issues
  like that any more.  &nbsp;<a href="#FR5" name="FN5">&uarr;</a></p></li>

  <li><p>The popular C and C++ development tools didn&rsquo;t include
  Winsock libraries and headers for years after Winsock was created,
  and of course there was more time needed before those newer
  tools saw widespread adoption. So, in the early years of Winsock
  development, each developer had their own lash-up to build Winsock
  programs.  &nbsp;<a href="#FR6" name="FN6">&uarr;</a></p></li>
