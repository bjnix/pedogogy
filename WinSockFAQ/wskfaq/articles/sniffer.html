<h2>The Straight Dope on Packet Sniffers</h2>

<p><i>by Warren Young</i></p>

<h4>Where the Name Came From</h4>

<p>Originally, Sniffer was the name of a hardware network analyzer,
a device that you could plug into a LAN to capture packets, decode
them, and display them. There were multiple versions of this device,
some looking like a luggable PC from the late 1980s, others looking
more like a high-end oscilloscope. It was basically a special-purpose
computer, designed to capture, decode and display packets on the LAN
you plugged it into. They cost over $10,000, and so were popular only
among large network administrators. (That is to say, administrators of
large networks. Some network administrators are large, but we&rsquo;re
not going to go into that here.)</p>

<p>Those of us not fortunate enough to have budgets that could absorb
a 5-figure analyzer ran software on PCs that made them do much the
same thing. The proper term for such software is a packet, network
or protocol analyzer, but over time such programs became colloquially
known as &ldquo;sniffers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is common for general-purpose PCs to be quite unable to cope
with a full network pipe. (Ever try to get a solid gigabit per second
out of a Windows 98 box?) This is not usually a problem, because most
of the time a single PC has no actual need to fill a network pipe,
or accept data at the full network data rate. Most of the traffic
on the LAN is typically destined for other nodes, and most LANs
aren&rsquo;t overdesigned to the extent that they will actually
allow all nodes to run at full capacity all the time. In practice,
we usually don&rsquo;t even <i>want</i> that. Small LANs, such as
those run by the unfortunates mentioned above, often have lulls where
there is little or no traffic at all.</p>

<p>This brings us to the <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> for hardware
network analyzers: sometimes those assumptions are not valid. Sometimes
you do have single computers studly enough to fill a network pipe to
its full rated capacity. Sometimes the LAN is so heavily loaded that
there are no lulls. Sometimes you need to sniff traffic between more
than just two computers at a time. In the 1990s, if you had big data
problems, you wanted a dedicated hardware packet analyzer; a PC running
a freeware program downloaded from a BBS wouldn&rsquo;t cut it.</p>

<p>There are workarounds for those with big-data problems but no
money for a hardware analyzer. The better sort of software analyzers
use special network stack facilities to push some filtering as far
back toward the hardware level as possible. Failing that, a software
sniffer can just drop packets when overloaded. A more elegant solution,
often combined with kernel-level packet filtering, is to truncate
captured packets, passing only as much as absolutely required down
to the sniffer program in user space. If you have a computer with <a
href="http://tcpdump.org/">tcpdump</a> on it, you&rsquo;re likely to
find that it was built with the default configuration, in which it
defaults to capturing only the first 68 bytes of each packet. That
reduces the load on the PC&rsquo;s network stack and I/O subsystems,
and is enough for many network analysis tasks.</p>

<p>Fast PCs with solid but inexpensive network hardware
running <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>
have evaporated the dedicated hardware network analyzer
market. The Sniffer name has changed hands a few times in the
turbulence caused by this market shift, and is now owned by <a
href="http://www.netscout.com/">NetScout</a> as I write this. <a
href="http://www.netscout.com/products/sniffer_portable_analyzer.asp">Today&rsquo;s
Sniffer</a> is software for Windows PCs.</p>


<h4>What Sniffers Can Do</h4>

<p>At bottom, a sniffer captures the raw data in each network
packet, then parses that packet to make some sense of it. A sniffer
may run packets through some selection process, write the selected
packets&rsquo; raw data to disk, display some representation of each
captured packet on the screen, or accumulate statistics from the
captured packets for some aggregate display. Some sniffers do only
one of these things, but most do some combination.</p>

<p>Virtually all sniffers have some sort of screen display. Such
displays vary greatly in their degree of readability and usefulness
for a particular purpose. Some are so primitive that they require
you to have a book of network protocol specifications in one hand
and a programmer&rsquo;s calculator in the other if you are to make
sense of them. Others layer so much GUI glitz on top that any techie
with a pulse can be expected to get something useful out of the
display; these necessarily hide a lot of details. Sniffers suitable
for programmers fall somewhere between these extremes. Programmers
usually don&rsquo;t have to understand the protocols they use down
to the bit level, but they frequently also need more info than you
can get from cool gauges and graphs.</p>

<p>A sniffer may be able to see all packets on the LAN, even those
not destined for the computer you are running it on. This is because
most LAN technologies echo each packet from one LAN node to every
other LAN node. They do this because it&rsquo;s cheap.</p>

<p>This is true of the dumb hubs used for most <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BaseT">10BaseT</a> and
some 100BaseT Ethernet LANs, with the bus topology of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10Base2">10Base2</a>,
and with the token passing structure of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_ring">Token Ring</a>. It
is also true of all wireless LAN technologies like WiFi, due to the
nature of radio communication. It is not true of all LAN technologies,
a detail we&rsquo;ll ignore for now.</p>

<p>A sniffer can take advantage of such LAN technologies to monitor
network traffic between two other nodes on the LAN.</p>


<h4>How to Defeat a Sniffer</h4>

<h5>Network Adapter Promiscuity</h5>

<p>In the very earliest days of LAN technology, a LAN adapter merely
transformed the electrical impulses on the LAN medium into data that
could be processed in software. Virtually every network adapter
produced in the past three decades performs at least one slightly
more advanced function: it is able to look at the hardware address for
each packet and based on that, decide whether to ignore the packet. A
network adapter normally drops packets not addressed to it.</p>

<p>If you only wish to sniff packets to or from the computer you are
running the sniffer on, this hardware address-based filtering is not
a problem.</p>

<p>It is sometimes possible to defeat this filtering, so that your
computer can eavesdrop on packets destined for another LAN node.
Network adapters for LAN technologies that allow this can often be put
into &ldquo;promiscuous mode,&rdquo; telling it that the computer is
interested in <i>all</i> packets. The sniffer is then able to make
its own decisions about which packets are interesting, then decode
and display them for the benefit of the sniffer&rsquo;s operator.</p>

<p>Not all network adapters support promiscuous mode, even when the
underlying LAN technology allows it. You sometimes see this with really
cheap Ethernet chips, as well as with many wireless LAN adapters.</p>

<p>Your PC may not be able to keep up with the increased load caused
by enabling promiscuous mode. The solutions are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>get a faster PC</li>

	<li>accept that some packets will be dropped</li>

	<li>configure the sniffer to truncate packets</li>

	<li>configure the sniffer to use a stricter packet selection
	filter</li>
</ul>


<h5>Packet Switching</h5>

<p>Not all LAN technologies echo all packets to all nodes on the
LAN.</p>

<p>Over the years, as networks have become faster and processing power
cheaper, switched Ethernet has become more common. Packet switching
makes for faster networks because it pushes many decisions about
which LAN ports need to see which packets into the switch.</p>

<p>Consider a small switched Ethernet LAN with three nodes. If a PC
plugged into port 1 on the Ethernet switch establishes a TCP connection
to a PC plugged into port 2, a switch will route the packets making
up this connection between just those two ports. The PC plugged into
port 3 won&rsquo;t be able to sniff those packets. The brains that
make this possible are the reason switches cost more than comparably
specified hubs.</p>

<p>Theoretically, an 8-port gigabit network switch is able to carry 8
total gigabits of data per second. For instance, you could have ports
1 and 2 sending a gigabit per second bidirectionally to each other,
and the same for 3 and 4, 5 and 6, and 7 and 8. In actual fact,
only the highest end switches can achieve this ideal, but even a
cheap switch offers real speed advantages over a dumb hub. These
speed adavantages are significant enough that for gigabit Ethernet
and a faster, switches are actually required. They are also required
when setting up mixed-speed LANs: a dumb 100BaseT hub requires that
all nodes support 100 Mbit/s connections, or else all fall down to 10
Mbit/s. A switch is able to support a mix of 10 and 100 Mbit/s nodes,
each operating at their fastest native speed.</p>

<p>You do still find cheap 100BaseT hubs, even as of this writing, in
2010. The cost difference between a 100BaseT hub and switch is small,
but for applications where they&rsquo;re cutting costs by still using
100BaseT in the first place, the cost savings can be important.</p>

<p>Packet switching was expensive tech back in the days of 10BaseT,
something they did only at the core of large networks to help partition
the traffic without resorting to even more expensive routers. Chances
are excellent that if you run across a 10BaseT network, it uses dumb
hubs for most, if not all, connections.</p>

<p>Above, we implied that with switched Ethernet, only the two
nodes involved in a given conversation can see the packets going
between them. That was a simplistic view. The real situation is a
bit more nuanced.</p>

<p>First, Ethernet switches often have a &ldquo;port mirroring&rdquo;
feature that makes it copy traffic destined for one port to
another. Only the cheapest sort of switch lacks this feature today.</p>

<p>Second, <a href="../intermediate.html#broadcast">broadcast</a>
traffic still goes out to all nodes on a switched Ethernet
LAN, unless it&rsquo;s purposely partitioned into two or more <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlan">VLANs</a>. Broadcast traffic
is usually a minority player on any LAN because it is inefficient,
but there is still a fair bit of it even on a well-managed LAN. ARP,
Bonjour, UPnP, Windows file and print sharing, and other protocols
require broadcast packets. Some of these protocols are entirely
broadcast.</p>

<p>Third, the protocol you&rsquo;re looking to monitor might use
multicast. Monitoring multicast traffic isn&rsquo;t effortless as
with broadcast, but it&rsquo;s pretty simple, even in the face of
switched Ethernet. Say you have a small LAN of 8 nodes, and the PCs
plugged into LAN ports 1-6 are watching a multicast video stream
coming from a networked video camera plugged into port 7. A smart
Ethernet switch won&rsquo;t copy those packets to port 8. It is a
trivial matter, however, to write a program to join that multicast
group. This causes the stack to send out an IGMP packet which the
switch will see, telling it to start forwarding multicast packets
destined for that group to port 8 as well.</p>


<h5>Admin Access</h5>

<p>As computers have become more critical to daily life and business,
the security systems on them have gotten stricter.</p>

<p>Ethernet switches with port mirroring abilities often protect
access to this feature with a password. Packet switching offers a
small measure of improved security on a network. It is the sort of
security that adds depth to a strong security regime. Even though it
is not enough in itself to secure a network, a network admin that
doesn&rsquo;t trust you still won&rsquo;t turn on port mirroring
for you.</p>

<p>Local computer security is another impediment to an intrepid
packet sniffer. Modern OSes block access to the low levels of the
stack needed to do packet capturing. There are several facets to
this. On Windows, you need local admin access to install the driver
you need to perform the packet capturing. Depending on how that driver
is itself secured, you might then need admin access to talk to the
driver. (Some systems are configured to let certain users or groups
of users do packet capturing once support for it is enabled at the
kernel level.) Finally, if you need to do promiscuous packet captures,
you typically need admin access to enable this feature of the network
adapter, quite separate from the actual packet capturing process.</p>


<h5>Routers</h5>

<p>The traffic you are interested in monitoring might be going over
a WAN, such as the Internet. Because WAN links are typically much
slower than even the cheapest common LAN technology of the day,
they have to be guarded from overuse. This is what routers do.</p>

<p>A router is a smart device that is able to recognize which packets
on the fast LAN really must be forwarded through the slow WAN link,
and which do not.</p>

<p>You may have a cheap Internet router at home with several LAN
ports on it, and one Internet port. You can use it to transfer files
between two PCs on the LAN at much faster speeds than the Internet
link can provide, while a third computer pulls down a different file
at much lower speed from the Internet. Because there are routers on
both ends of the Internet connection, PCs on either end cannot use
sniffer software to see traffic that exists only one one end of the
link. Your ISP cannot see the file transfer between the LAN nodes, and
a PC on that LAN cannot sniff data going between two other customers
of your ISP.</p>

<p>The boundary between LAN and WAN can get a bit fuzzy. Cable Internet
systems often put many homes within a certain geographical area onto a
single shared LAN. If neither you nor your neighbor have a home router,
you might be able to sniff his Internet traffic, because you&rsquo;re
on the same LAN. That said, you probably can&rsquo;t sniff traffic
between two computers across town that also use the same cable Internet
service, because there is probably a router somewhere between.</p>
