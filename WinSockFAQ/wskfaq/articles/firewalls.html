<h3>Dealing with Firewalls</h3>

<p><i>by Warren Young</i></p>

<p>Firewalls are everywhere. It seems like everyone&rsquo;s company LAN
is connected to the Internet these days, and nearly all those companies
have prudently put their LAN behind some kind of firewall. So,
it&rsquo;s likely that some day someone will try to use your client
or server across their firewall. Depending on a number of factors,
this may work without trouble, or you may run into many problems
trying to make this work. This article will discuss these problems
and some of the solutions to them.</p>



<h4>How Your Protocol Affects Firewalls</h4>

<p>For the greatest chances of working through a firewall without
trouble, you should use a simple single-connection TCP-based protocol:
the client connects to the server, sends data and gets replies on
that connection, and when finished closes the connection.</p>

<p>For an example of a protocol that causes problems with firewalls,
consider FTP. FTP has two connections: a control connection and a
data connection. The control connection is always present, but the
data connection is brought up only when the server needs to send bulk
data to the client, such as a directory listing or the contents of
a file.</p>

<p>In traditional &ldquo;active&rdquo; mode, the FTP server connects
back to the client to establish the data connection. The problem
is, the client has to tell the server which port number it&rsquo;s
listening on for the data connection. When the client is behind a
firewall, the server believes it&rsquo;s connected to the firewall
machine, so it tries to connect to the given port on the firewall,
which isn&rsquo;t listening for the connection. The server gets
rejected, and the client sits waiting forever for the server to
connect to it.</p>

<p>There are two solutions to this problem. The first is for the
client to use &ldquo;passive&rdquo; mode: the client connects to the
server for the data connection, instead of the server connecting to
the client. The other solution is for the firewall to know the FTP
protocol, so it can recognize the FTP data connection port number
within the protocol, rewrite it to a port the firewall can use,
and then listen on that port.  When the FTP server connects to the
firewall, the firewall can then connect to the FTP client inside the
firewall and begin relaying data.</p>

<p>Unless you&rsquo;re writing a client for a well-known protocol,
you should try to write it so the firewall doesn&rsquo;t have to
know your protocol in order to forward packets. For the longest time,
RealAudio clients didn&rsquo;t work behind firewalls because of the
way Real Networks designed the protocol. Today that isn&rsquo;t a
problem, but it took Real years to achieve the success they needed
to get firewall vendors to add support for their protocol.</p>


<h4>Clients Behind Masquerading Firewalls</h4>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume that your client uses a simple single-connection
TCP-based protocol. There are still potential problems ahead: the
type of firewall can make a difference to your client.</p>

<p>From a client program&rsquo;s perspective, the simplest kind of
firewall is the masquerading firewall. They appear to hosts inside
the firewall like a simple gateway to the Internet.</p>

<p>A masquerading firewall is fairly tricky from a technical
perspective. Packets destined for the Internet go to the masquerading
firewall, which changes the internal IP address and source port number
of outbound packets to the firewall machine&rsquo;s IP address and
a generated port number. Then they pass the packet outside to the
Internet and wait for the reply. When the reply comes back, the
firewall recognizes the port number it generated, and uses that to
translate the port and IP back to the &ldquo;internal&rdquo; values,
then passes it on to the host inside the LAN.</p>

<p>If your protocol is simple, your program should work through
a masquerading firewall without problems. The only likely problem
you&rsquo;ll run into is if the firewall blocks outbound connections
to all but a few select ports. In this case, you&rsquo;ll have to
ask the firewall&rsquo;s administrator to open up your port. This
is discussed in more detail below in the "Firewalls, Politics and
Paranoia" section.</p>



<h4>Clients Behind SOCKS Firewalls</h4>

<p>If a firewall doesn&rsquo;t do masquerading, it
will usually allow clients to get through it via the <a
href="../../rfcs/useful.html#rfc1928">SOCKS protocol</a>. SOCKS allows
a client program on a protected internal network to ask the firewall
to act as a relay between it and a host outside the firewall.</p>

<p>SOCKS version 4 is the &ldquo;basic&rdquo; protocol. The main
difference between masquerading and SOCKS v4 is that masquerading
is transparent, whereas with SOCKS you have to modify your program
to make SOCKS requests to get through the firewall. (SOCKS v4 also
has a few features masquerading doesn&rsquo;t, like basic plaintext
authentication, but this is a minor issue.)</p>

<p>SOCKS version 5 builds on that base and adds UDP support, end-to-end
encryption, and secure logins. These latter two features make it much
more secure than SOCKS v4 and masquerading, so it&rsquo;s becoming
quite common. Few firewalls require encryption to get through, but
quite a few are requiring SOCKS v5 logins, to curtail rogue programs
getting through the firewall.</p>

<p>You can find out more about SOCKS via the following links:</p>

	personal and educational use), a lot of <a

	info</a>, and some commercial products, including a commercial

	Resources</a> &ndash; Lots of good links.

	The Border Service Enabler</a> technical backgrounder &ndash;
	This looks like a good introduction to the SOCKS protocol.
-->
</ul>

<p>Permeo&rsquo;s SOCKSCap allows almost any Winsock program to run
over a SOCKS firewall with no changes to the application. (There
are other vendors that offer SOCKSifiers, and a few non-Microsoft
Winsock stacks are SOCKSified.) The problem with SOCKSCap is that
your users must set up SOCKSCap by hand, and they must run your
program <i>through</i> the SOCKSifier. It&rsquo;s more user-friendly
to implement the SOCKS protocol within your program.</p>

<p>SOCKS does let you get around some of the limitations imposed by
a masquerading firewall. For one thing, you can do a &ldquo;remote
bind:&ldquo; ask the firewall to listen on a port for you, and pass
connections in to your program. SOCKS v5&rsquo;s UDP support may also
prove helpful to you. Just beware that even SOCKS firewalls can limit
your design choices.</p>



<h4>Firewalls, Politics and Paranoia</h4>

<p>Technical people often look at a firewall as a technical solution
to a technical problem. In actual fact, a firewall is a political
construct.  Like a country&rsquo;s border, it exists to protect
an organization&rsquo;s turf from invaders. The permeability of a
network firewall depends on the paranoia level of the people who
control the firewall: there&rsquo;s a lot to be paranoid about in
today&rsquo;s Internet.</p>

<p>Many firewalls are set up to block all outbound connections except
to a very few ports. For example, the firewall might be set up to
allow outbound connections on ports 80, 21 and 25 only (web, FTP and
outbound email). If your application uses a port that the firewall
blocks, you will have to persuade the network administrators to open
up that port on <i>their</i> firewall. Network admins are often very
territorial about their firewalls. Getting your way will require a
certain amount of political finesse.</p>

<p>The administrators at such a site have decided that they&rsquo;d
rather open ports on a case-by-case basis than block ports as new
security risks get discovered. You have to convince the admins to
open up your port. I suggest that you prepare a written argument
explaining what your program does, why it does it, and an analysis
of potential risks. Don&rsquo;t fudge on the argument: be completely
honest and open. Present the benefits of the application separately;
you&rsquo;re not trying to convince the admins to use the program, just
to show that the application is useful to users on their network. Try
to get some of those users to speak with the network admins directly
to help you press your case.</p>

<p>Why a written argument? Partly because it shows professionalism,
partly because you might not be able to speak with the admins
directly, and partly because it forces you to clarify and organize
your thoughts.  If you just call the admin up on the phone and make
up your arguments as you speak with him, you may just come across
as <i>argumentative</i>.  Even if you do end up speaking with the
administrator directly, having a written argument to refer to will
help you to make your case.</p>

<p>Some people suggest a different tactic: change your program so that
it sends its packets out on a port that&rsquo;s open on even the most
restrictive firewalls. Because some firewalls examine the contents
of packets to make sure they&rsquo;re legitimate, some people even
suggest encapsulating your data in the protocol that usually runs
on that port. For example, you could send your data out on port 80,
and put your program data in the payload area of HTTP packets.</p>

<p>To extend the political analogy, this is the smuggling tactic. Just
like smuggling in the real world, it&rsquo;s likely to get you into
trouble. You won&rsquo;t go to jail for it, but you might generate
a lot of antagonism toward your program; network admins have been
known to band together and ban programs that annoy them.</p>



<h4>Servers Behind Firewalls</h4>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve written a server program. It works
fine, but then someone tries to use it behind a firewall, while the
clients are on the other side of the firewall. This is very common
when the server is running on someone&rsquo;s LAN, but they want to
access your server from out on the wider Internet.</p>

<p>The easiest solution is simply to move the server outside the
firewall, but most network administrators are extremely reluctant to
do this. Common reasons are:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Most of the users are inside the firewall: the users
	outside are the exception, not the rule.<pbr>

	<li>The firewall setup doesn&rsquo;t allow anything outside
	the firewall.<pbr>

	<li>The firewall is administered by some other party, like
	the company&rsquo;s ISP, and they won&rsquo;t allow you to
	put your server outside their firewall.<pbr>

	<li>If you can put the server behind the firewall, the firewall
	can control access to the server: it&rsquo;s an extra layer of
	protection between your server and the big bad Internet.<pbr>

	<li>It&rsquo;s axiomatic that you should not expose any more
	services to the outside world than you have to. Some network
	admins will stubbornly fall back on this despite any arguments
	you can muster, no matter how logical.<pbr>
</ol>

<p>If you run into this, the solution is to get the firewall
administrator to set up &ldquo;network address translation.&rdquo;
NAT is a term for several vaguely-related techniques, two of which
you can use to make your server visible outside the firewall: port
forwarding and address forwarding.</p>

<p>To understand NAT, consider the following LAN setup: the internal
LAN hosts use the private IP address block 10.x.x.x. Let&rsquo;s
say the host your server is running on has the internal IP address
10.1.2.3. Their ISP has assigned this company the public IP subnet
123.4.5.{1-15}. The firewall has at least two addresses: let&rsquo;s
say 123.4.5.1 on the outside, and 10.1.1.1 on the inside.</p>

<p>Address forwarding is the simplest, but also the riskier of the
two approaches. To set up address forwarding for our example LAN,
the firewall could assign 123.4.5.2 to your server. Whenever requests
come in on that address, it quietly translates the destination address
to 10.1.2.3 and the source address to 10.1.1.1, and then it passes
the packet inside the LAN for your server to handle. When your server
replies, it believes it is replying to the firewall at 10.1.1.1. The
firewall gets the reply packet and translates the source address to
123.4.5.2 and the destination address to that of the host that made
the initial request. Then it sends the packet out onto the Internet
which routes the reply back to the client.</p>

<p>The problem with address translation is that if your server
host has any security holes, the firewall will let anyone outside
break in through those holes. Once they&rsquo;re inside your server,
they&rsquo;re also effectively inside the LAN, so the firewall&rsquo;s
protection is totally gone.</p>

<p>The more secure NAT technology is port translation. Let&rsquo;s
say your server uses port 1234. When you set up port translation on
the firewall, it begins listening for packets on that port, which
it forwards inside the firewall to your server. This is more secure
because it only exposes that one port to the outside world.</p>

<p>Sometimes address and port translation are combined. Let&rsquo;s
say the firewall only has one outside IP address available to it,
and that you have several servers inside the LAN that use the same
port. The firewall&rsquo;s NAT features may allow it to listen on
ports 2000 through 2007 and translate packets coming in to each of
those ports to different hosts inside the LAN, each with the same port,
like your server&rsquo;s 1234.</p>

<p>Not all of these options are available on all firewalls, and the
network adminstrator might not know how to use these features even if
they are present. Or, they may simply be unwilling to let your server
be visible from outside the firewall. Just like with the political
issues with clients discussed above, resist the temptation to piggyback
your protocol on top of an &ldquo;approved&rdquo; port and protocol,
unless the firewall administrator gives you permission.</p>

of firewalls or other problems getting through firewalls, please <a
