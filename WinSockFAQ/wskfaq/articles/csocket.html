<h3>CSocket Considered Harmful</h3>

<p><i>by Warren Young</i></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re an MFC user, you&rsquo;ve probably thought
about using the library&rsquo;s CAsyncSocket class or one of its
derivatives. Unfortunately, the entire hierarchy has problems that
you should know about before you start writing code.</p>

<h4>CAsyncSocket</h4>

<p>CAsyncSocket is a bare-bones asynchronous sockets
wrapper. There are now two examples in the FAQ that show
<a href="../examples/basics/AsyncClient/index.html">straight-to-the-API</a> and
<a href="../examples/basics/CASClient/index.html">CAsyncSocket-based</a> clients.</p>

<p>If you download and study the examples, you can see that the
CAsyncSocket version isn&rsquo;t much smaller, and it has a couple of
problems. First, CAsyncSocket does synchronous DNS lookups, so a slow
DNS server can cause a program to block for a very long time. Second,
you can&rsquo;t derive a class from both CAsyncSocket and CWnd,
because they have a base class conflict that the compiler can&rsquo;t
resolve. This means you can&rsquo;t set up network timeouts, among
other things. This is a design mistake: CAsyncSocket should have
been derived from CWnd, because it receives window messages from
Winsock. (That would let you have Window timers, too.) Instead,
CAsyncSocket creates a separate window to handle these messages.</p>

<h4>CSocket</h4>

<p>With CSocket the trend goes from mediocre to bad.</p>

<p>CSocket is a subclass of CAsyncSocket that "fakes" blocking I/O
using asynchronous sockets by running a small message pump every time
it gets a <code>WSAEWOULDBLOCK</code> error. This is technically cute,
but it can cause reentrancy side effects. While CSocket is "blocking",
it&rsquo;s pumping window messages, which allows a message to trigger
another call to the blocking CSocket object. The full list of similar
and related problems is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<p>CSocket has outright bugs, too: CSocket tends to crash or raise
assertions when used in nontrivial situations. Who ever heard of
a network app worth using that didn&rsquo;t get pushed beyond its
original design specs?</p>

<p>The most damning criticism of CSocket, though, is that true blocking
sockets are easy to come by: Winsock blocking sockets are dead easy to
program. Why would you choose fake and buggy blocking sockets when you
can get bug-free blocking sockets that are less complex to boot?</p>

<h4>CCESocket</h4>

<p>CAsyncSocket and CSocket don&rsquo;t work on Windows CE
because it only supports Berkeley-style blocking and nonblocking
sockets. Microsoft didn&rsquo;t want to give up asynchronous
notification, so they committed designicide once again: there&rsquo;s
now a subclass of CSocket (!) called CCESocket that emulates
asynchronous notifications using a pair of worker threads and blocking
sockets.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Let&rsquo;s summarize the story: First we had asynchronous
sockets. Then we added a layer on top to make those asynchronous
sockets look synchronous. Then we added a layer on top of that that
uses synchronous sockets &mdash; not the base class&rsquo;s fake
synchronicity but this time real Winsock blocking sockets &mdash;
to mimic asynchronous sockets. This last layer must override almost
all the base class functionality! Clue to Redmond: it&rsquo;s time
to lay off the large latt&eacute;s.</p>

<p>CSocket breaks the &ldquo;is a&rdquo; rule of good object oriented
design. With this hierarchy, Microsoft is saying, &ldquo;a blocking
socket is an asynchronous socket, and a sorta-asynchronous thread-based
socket is a blocking socket, but not necessarily the reverse.&rdquo;
I feel like I&rsquo;m watching The Three Stooges...</p>

<p>The only class in the hierarchy that&rsquo;s at all usable
is CAsyncSocket, but <i>usable</i> isn&rsquo;t the same thing as
<i>useful</i>. If my needs are simple, it&rsquo;s nearly as easy to
write straight Winsock API code. If I have tough networking problems
to solve, I use an intelligent class library that does more than
simply wrapping Winsock. Such wrappers offer features like buffering
and dissection of TCP streams into logical packets. (You can find
several on the <a href="../resources/libraries.html">Libraries</a> page.) Given
these resources, why would I ever want to use CAsyncSocket?</p>

<p>The cause of this design mess is obvious to any student of Microsoft
design history: they started with a usable idea, and then repeatedly
added layers to it without considering whether the new layer actually
fits conceptually within the existing framework. Refactoring is a
foreign concept to Microsoft. At best they&rsquo;ll deprecate an old
interface, but even that&rsquo;s usually a toothless threat. How many
deprecated and never-documented Win16 APIs are in Win2000?</p>

<p>Bad design is a sign of messy thinking. That&rsquo;s not a helpful
trait for someone writing foundation libraries.</p>
