<h3>How to Use TCP Effectively</h3>

<p><i>by Warren Young</i></p>

<p>Newcomers to network programming almost always run into problems
early on where it looks like the network or the TCP/IP stack is munging
your data. This usually comes as quite a shock, because the newcomer
is usually told just before this that TCP is a reliable data transport
protocol. In fact, TCP and Winsock are quite reliable if you use them
properly. This tutorial will discuss the most common problems people
come across when learning to use TCP.</p>

<h4>Problem 1: Packets Are Illusions</h4>

<p>This problem comes up in various guises:</p>

<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;My client program sent 100 bytes, but the server program
  only got 50.&rdquo;

  <li>&ldquo;My client program sent several small packets, but the
  server program received one large packet.&rdquo;

  <li>&ldquo;How can I find out how many bytes are waiting on a
  given socket, so I can set up a receive buffer for the size of
  the packet?&rdquo;
</ul>

<p>I think that understanding this issue is one of TCP/IP&rsquo;s
rites of passage.</p>

<p>The core concept that you must grasp is that TCP is a <i>stream</i>
protocol. This means that if you send 100 bytes, the receiving end
could receive all 100 bytes at once, or 100 separate single bytes, or
four 25-byte chunks. Even more confusing, the receiver could receive
that 100 byte block plus some data from the previous send and some
from the succeeding send.</p>

<p>So, you ask, how can you make a program receive whole packets
only?</p>

<p>The easiest method is to prefix each packet with a length value. For
example, you could prefix every packet with a 2-byte unsigned integer
that tells how long the packet is. Length prefixes are most effective
when the data in each protocol packet has no particular structure,
such as raw binary data. See <a href="../examples/packetize.html">this example</a>
for code that reads length-prefixed packets from a TCP stream.</p>

<p>Another method for setting up packets on top of a stream protocol
is called &ldquo;delimiting.&rdquo; Each packet you send in such a
scheme is followed by a unique delimiter. The trick is to think of
a good delimiter; it must be a character or string of characters
that will <i>never</i> occur inside a packet. Some good examples
of delimited protocols are NNTP, POP3, and SMTP, all of which use a
carriage-return/line-feed ("CRLF") pair as their delimiter. Delimiting
generally only works well with text-based protocols, because by design
they limit themselves to a subset of all the legal characters; that
leaves plenty of possible delimiters to choose from.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also possible to have a mixed approach. HTTP,
for example, has CRLF-delimited headers, one of which can be
"Content-length", which is a length prefix for the data following
the headers.</p>

<p>Of these two methods, I prefer length-prefixing, because delimiting
requires your program to blindly read until it finds the end of
the packet, whereas length prefixing lets the program start dealing
with the packet just as soon as the length prefix comes in. On the
other hand, delimiting schemes lend themselves to flexibility, if you
design the protocol like a computer language; this implies that your
protocols parsers will be complex.</p>

<p>There are a couple of other concerns for properly handling packets
atop TCP. First, always check the return value of <code>recv()</code>, which
indicates how many bytes it placed in your buffer &mdash; it may
well return fewer bytes than you expect. Second, don&rsquo;t try to
<a href="../newbie.html#peeking">peek</a> into the Winsock stack&rsquo;s
buffers to see if a complete packet has arrived. For various reasons,
peeking causes problems. Instead, read all the data directly into
your application&rsquo;s buffers and process it there.</p>


<a name="problem2">
<h4>Problem 2: Byte Ordering</h4>

<p>You have undoubtedly noticed all the <code>ntohs()</code> and <code>htonl()</code>
calls required in Winsock programming, but you might not know
<i>why</i> they are required. The reason is that there are two common
ways of storing integers on a computer: <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/B/big-endian.html">big-endian</a> and
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/L/little-endian.html">little-endian</a>.  Big-endian numbers are stored with the
most significant byte in the lowest memory location ("big-end first"),
whereas little-endian systems reverse this. Obviously two computers
must agree on a common number format if they are to communicate, so
the TCP/IP specification defines a &ldquo;network byte order&rdquo;
that the headers (and thus Winsock) all use.</p>

<p>The end result is, if you are sending bare integers as part of
your network protocol, and the receiving end is on a platform that
uses a different integer representation, it will perceive the data
as garbled. To fix this, follow the lead of the TCP protocol and use
network byte order, always.</p>

<p>The same principles apply to other platform-specific data
formats, such as floating-point values. Winsock does not define
functions to create platform-neutral representations of data
other than integers, but there is a protocol called the <a
href="/rfcs/useful.html#rfc1832">External Data Representation</a>
(XDR) which does handle this. XDR formalizes a platform-independent
way for two computers to send each other various types of data. XDR is
simple enough that you can probably implement it yourself; alternately,
you might take a look at the <a href="../resources/libraries.html">Libraries</a>
page to find libraries that implement the XDR protocol.</p>

<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, network byte order is big-endian, though
you should never take advantage of this fact. Some programmers working
on big-endian machines ignore byte ordering issues, but this makes
your code non-portable, and it can become a bad habit that will bite
you later. The most common little-endian CPUs are the Intel x86 and
the Digital Alpha. Most everything else is big-endian. There are a few
"bi-endian" devices that can operate in either mode, like the PowerPC
and the HP PA-RISC 8000. Most PowerPCs always run in big-endian mode,
however, and I suspect that the same is true of the PA-RISC.</p>


<h4>Problem 3: Structure Padding</h4>

<p>To illustrate the structure padding problem, consider this C
declaration:</p>

<pre>
                struct foo {
                    char a;
                    int b;
                    char c;
                } foo_instance;
</pre>

<p>Assuming 32-bit <code>int</code>s, you might guess that the structure
occupies 6 bytes, but this is not so. For efficiency reasons, compilers
"pad" structures to align the data members in a way that is convenient
for the CPU. Most CPUs can access 32-bit integers faster if they
are at addresses evenly divisible by 4, so the above structure would
probably take up 12 bytes on these systems. This issue rears its head
when you try to send a structure over Winsock whole, like this:</p>

<pre>
                send(sd, (char*)&foo_instance, sizeof(foo), 0);
</pre>

<p>Unless the receiving program was compiled on the same machine
architecture with the same compiler and the same compiler options,
you have no guarantee that the other machine will receive the data
correctly.</p>

<p>The solution is to always send structures &ldquo;packed&rdquo; by
sending the data members one at a time. You can force your compiler
to pack the structures for you, with a resulting speed penalty in
the code that accesses those structures. Visual C++ can do this with
the <code>/Zp</code> command line option or the <code>#pragma pack</code>
directive, and Borland C++ can do this with the <code>-a</code> command
line option. Keep the byte ordering problem in mind, however: if
you send a packed structure in place, be sure to reorder its bytes
properly before you send it.</p>


<h4>The Moral of the Story</h4>

<p>Trust Winsock to send your data correctly, but don&rsquo;t assume
that it works the way you think that it ought to!</p>
