<h3>BSD Sockets Compatibility</h3>

<p><i>by Warren Young</i></p>

<p>So you say you&rsquo;re a long-time Unix hacker who&rsquo;s new to
Windows programming? And you&rsquo;ve heard of this great API called
Winsock that&rsquo;s compatibile with your beloved BSD sockets,
but try as you might, you just can&rsquo;t find the <code>readv()</code>
call? Well bunky, this is the article for you.</p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>In the beginning, there was chaos in the world of Windows TCP/IP
APIs.  A program written for, say, FTP Software&rsquo;s TCP/IP stack
wouldn&rsquo;t run on JSB&rsquo;s stack.</p>

<p>Then, sometime in 1990, a bunch of people got together and decided
to make one nice, big, compatible API called Windows Sockets that
would allow a single program to run on any vendor&rsquo;s stack. They
decided to base this API on the popular BSD sockets model of network
programming, but for various reasons, there are still many differences
between Winsock and BSD sockets. This article points out how Winsock
differs from BSD sockets, and how to translate BSD sockets programs
to use similar Winsock functionality.</p>



<h4>The Official Word</h4>

<p>The Winsock API documentation has a section called <a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winsock/winsock/porting_socket_applications_to_winsock.asp">Porting
Socket Applications to Winsock</a> that covers many of the same issues
that this article does, and a few others besides.</p>



<h4>#include Differences</h4>

<p>Under BSD sockets, there are quite a few different header files you
need to include, depending on what sockets calls you use. A typical BSD
sockets program has a block of #includes near the top like this:</p>

<p class=inset>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;<br>
               #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;<br>
               #include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;<br>
               #include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;<br>
               #include &lt;netdb.h&gt;
</p>

<p>For Winsock, you don&rsquo;t need any of these. Instead, you
just need to include winsock.h. (Or, if you need Winsock 2-specific
functionality, winsock2.h.)</p>



<h4><code>errno</code> vs. <code>WSAGetLastError()</code></h4>

<p><code>WSAGetLastError()</code> is essentially the same thing as
Unix&rsquo;s <code>errno</code> global variable. The error constants and
their values are different; there&rsquo;s a table in the Winsock
spec where it lists all the error constants, one column of which
shows the equivalent BSD error constant for a given Winsock error
constant. Usually the difference is just the addition of "WSA" to the
beginning of the constant name for the Winsock versions. (E.g. WSAEINTR
is the Winsock version of BSD&rsquo;s EINTR error constant.)</p>

<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that, although the <code>perror()</code>
call exists in most Windows compilers' run-time libraries, it
doesn&rsquo;t work for Winsock calls. (This is a consequence
of Winsock not returning its error codes in the <code>errno</code>
variable.) There is a function called <code>WSAGetLastErrorMessage()</code>
in the <a href="../examples/basics/index.html">basic Winsock examples</a> area of
the FAQ that you can use to build a <code>perror()</code>-like function.
It&rsquo;s in the ws-util.cpp module.</a>



<h4>EAGAIN</h4>

<p>Many Unix programs, especially those with System V roots, check
for the EAGAIN value in the global <code>errno</code> variable when
a non-blocking call fails. This is the same thing as BSD&rsquo;s
EWOULDBLOCK and Winsock&rsquo;s WSAEWOULDBLOCK errors. You&rsquo;ll
have to check your system&rsquo;s header files, but all Unixes
I&rsquo;ve checked on this matter #define EAGAIN and EWOULDBLOCK
to the same value, so you may want to get into the habit of using
EWOULDBLOCK instead of EAGAIN under Unix, to make transitions to and
from Winsock easier.</p>



<h4>Equivalence of File and Socket Handles</h4>

<p>Under Unix, the I/O system calls work with file descriptors and
socket descriptors equally well. It&rsquo;s common in BSD sockets
programs to use <code>read()</code> instead of <code>recv()</code> to read
data from a socket, for example. Under Windows 3.1 and Windows 95
derivatives, socket descriptors are completely distinct from file
descriptors. Although the run-time library (RTL) supplied with most
Windows compilers includes POSIX emulation functions, these are
designed to work only with files, not sockets.</p>

<p>Windows NT derivatives are more like Unix, in that its native file
I/O functions also work with sockets: <code>ReadFile()</code> is roughly
equivalent to Winsock&rsquo;s <code>recv()</code> function, for example.</p>

<p>The Visual C++ RTL emulates POSIX functions, except that
they&rsquo;re named with a leading underscore: for example,
<code>_read()</code> instead of <code>read()</code>. The <code>_read()</code> function
uses <code>ReadFile()</code> internally, so you&rsquo;d think it would work
with sockets. The problem is, the first argument is an RTL-specific
handle, not an operating system file handle. If you pass a socket
handle to <code>_read()</code> or <code>_write()</code>, the RTL will realize that
it isn&rsquo;t an RTL handle and the call will fail.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is a bridge function in Visual C++&rsquo;s
RTL: <code>_open_osfhandle()</code>. (If you&rsquo;re not using Visual
C++, you&rsquo;ll have to check its RTL source for a similar
function.) I&rsquo;ve not tried it, but it appears to take an operating
system file handle (including socket handles) and return a handle you
can use with the POSIX emulation functions in the RTL. I&rsquo;m told
that this will work with sanely-coded non-Microsoft Winsock stacks,
but since I haven&rsquo;t tried it, you should if you want to support
these alternate stacks.</p>

<p>Again, the <code>_open_osfhandle()</code> workaround only works on
Windows NT derivatives, because the file I/O functions don&rsquo;t
work with sockets on the Windows 95 derivatives, so fooling the RTL
into accepting one doesn&rsquo;t help you.</p>

<p>If these limitations are too much for your program, you may
want to give one of the Unix emulation systems a try. I&rsquo;ve
personally used <a href="http://cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> for this
purpose, and it works beautifully. Others include Microsoft&rsquo;s
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/sfu/">Services
for Unix</a> and AT&T&rsquo;s <a
href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin/">UWIN</a>, but
I&rsquo;ve not used either of them.</p>

<p>All that aside, it&rsquo;s usually much easier to rewrite your
program to use portable functions like <code>recv()</code> than it is to
arm-twist the Windows port to work with Unix idioms.</p>



<h4>Winsock&rsquo;s <code>closesocket()</code> vs. Unix&rsquo;s <code>close()</code></h4>

<p>Winsock defines a different function for closing sockets because
not all versions of Windows have file descriptor and socket descriptor
equivalency like Unix. See the discussion in the previous item for
more on the file/socket handle mismatch issue.</p>



<h4>Winsock&rsquo;s <code>ioctlsocket()</code> vs. Unix&rsquo;s <code>ioctl()</code></h4>

<p>Unix provides the <code>ioctl()</code> call to allow you to set and get
various bits of info on a file descriptor, which includes socket
descriptors. Winsock replicates some common Unix ioctls in the
<code>ioctlsocket()</code> call, but much is missing.</p>

<p>If you use the <code>SIOCGIFCONF</code> ioctl on Unix to
get information about the system&rsquo;s network interfaces,
Winsock 2 provides very similar functionality with its
<code>SIO_GET_INTERFACE_LIST</code> option for <code>ioctlsocket()</code>.</p>



<h4><code>fcntl()</code></h4>

<p>The Unix <code>fcntl()</code> call has no direct equivalent
under Winsock. Where necessary, similar functionality exists
in Winsock&rsquo;s <code>ioctlsocket()</code> call. For example, the
equivalent of using Unix&rsquo;s <code>fcntl()</code> to set a socket&rsquo;s
<tt>O_NONBLOCK</tt> flag is setting the <tt>FIONBIO</tt> flag with
Winsock&rsquo;s <code>ioctlsocket()</code>.</p>



<a name="poll"></a>
<h4><code>poll()</code></h4>

<p>There are several wrappers for
<code>poll()</code> using <code>select()</code> out there. <a
href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2001-October/069168.html">Here&rsquo;s
one</a>. It doesn&rsquo;t attempt to implement any of the special
<code>poll()</code> features found in a true System V system, such as
STREAMS support. Also, the code is rather old, written in a K&R
C style that some newer compilers might reject. Finally, since
it is built directly on top of <code>select()</code>, it has the same
<a href="../advanced.html#64sockets">limitations</a>.</p>

<p>Another option is to dig the implementation
of <code>poll()</code> out of Jarle Aasa&rsquo;s <a
href="http://adns.jgaa.com/">Win32 port</a> of the adns
library. This implementation has three limitations: 1) It&rsquo;s <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>&rsquo;d, which
means you can&rsquo;t use the code in your program unless your program
is also licensed under the GPL; 2) it&rsquo;s built on the Win32 event
object mechanism, which has a <a href="../advanced.html#64sockets">hard
64-object limitation</a>; and 3) it is reportedly not written in a
way that is easy for third-party programmers to extract and use.</p>



<h4><code>readv()</code> and <code>writev()</code></h4>

<p>Winsock 2&rsquo;s overlapped I/O mechanism includes scatter/gather
functionality similar to that provided by <code>readv()</code> and
<code>writev()</code>.</p>



<h4><code>dup()</code></h4>

<p>The Unix <code>dup()</code> function duplicates a file handle, and
of course also works for sockets. Under Winsock 2, you can do the
same thing with <code>WSADuplicateSocket()</code>. It&rsquo;s a bit more
involved, but the <code>WSADuplicateSocket()</code> documentation in <a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/">MSDN</a> has a good step-by-step
example showing how to use this mechansim.</p>



<h4><code>dup2()</code></h4>

<p>There is partial support for this feature under Winsock, though
the mechanism is dissimilar to the <code>dup2()</code> feature. Under Unix,
<code>dup2()</code> takes a handle and duplicates it like <code>dup()</code> does,
but with a twist: it assigns the new filehandle a value that you
specify. This is usually used to map a socket to the C language&rsquo;s
stdin or stdout file descriptors so that you can use standard I/O
functions like <code>printf()</code> and <code>fgets()</code> with the socket.</p>

<p>Item <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/190351">KB190351</a> in the Microsoft Knowledge Base documents
a method by which you can redirect a child process&rsquo;s standard
descriptors to a socket. The limitations are that you cannot do
this to your own process&rsquo;s descriptors, you cannot redirect
<i>arbitrary</i> descriptors to a socket (i.e. you can only do it with
stdin, stdout and stderr), and not all processes are fully compatible
with this API feature. Still, it at least makes an inetd-like program
possible under Win32.</p>


<h4>Detecting a Dropped Connection</h4>

<p>Under BSD Unixes, if the remote peer closes its connection
and your program is blocking on <code>recv()</code>, you will get
a 0 back from <code>recv()</code>. Winsock behaves the same way,
except that it can also return -1, with <code>WSAGetLastError()</code>
returning <code>WSAECONNRESET</code>, <code>WSAECONNABORTED</code>
or <code>WSAESHUTDOWN</code>, to signal the detectable flavors of
abnormal disconnections.</p>

<p>Under Unix, if you&rsquo;re blocking on <code>send()</code> and your
program is ignoring the <code>SIGPIPE</code> signal, it will return
with a -1 when the remote peer disconnects, and <code>errno</code> will
be <code>EPIPE</code>. Otherwise, your program will be sent the SIGPIPE
signal, which will terminate your program if you don&rsquo;t handle
it. Under Winsock, the SIGPIPE/EPIPE functionality does not exist at
all: <code>send()</code> will either return 0 for a normal disconnect or -1
for an abnormal disconnect, with <code>WSAGetLastError()</code> returning
the same errors as in the <code>recv()</code> discussion above.</p>



<h4>UDP Behavior</h4>

<p>According to Ilpo Ruotsalainen, "...most BSD socket implementations
do not pass delayed UDP errors (ICMP port unreachable at least, maybe
others too) to <code>recvfrom()</code> while Winsock 2 [under Windows 2000
but not Windows 98] does. Linux [behaves like Windows 2000] too,
but provives SO_BSDCOMPAT <code>setsockopt()</code> for being compatible
with the BSD style."</p>

<p>In other words, a portable program has to be prepared for
the possibility of error codes for non-immediate problems from
<code>recvfrom()</code>, but it can&rsquo;t depend on receiving them.</p>



<h4>A Cry For Updates</h4>

<p>This article can always use more work. If you can help me out,
please <a href="/email/">drop me a line</a>! In particular,
I&rsquo;ll bet that there are several other BSD-only <code>ioctl()</code>
options that we can duplicate in other ways with Win32 facilities.</p>
