<h3>Debugging TCP/IP</h3>

<p><i>by Warren Young</i></p>

<p><font size=-1>(This article was written with the Winsock programmer
in mind, but the information in it can be used by Unix programmers,
as well as administrators and technicians.)</font></p>

<p>TCP is a simple protocol in a certain sense: you send data, it
delivers it. Because it was engineered for reliability in networks of
uncertain quality, it works around a lot of problems without bothering
the end user. But partially because of this reliability, TCP exhibits
behaviors that surprise those that don&rsquo;t truly understand the
protocol. This tutorial will introduce you to the most important of
these issues, but it&rsquo;s really the tip of the iceberg. For the
submerged part, see <a href="../reviews/tcpillus.html">TCP/IP Illustrated</a>;
the state/transition diagram below comes from volume 2 of that
series. It happens to be printed in Volume 1 of the series as well, and
in Stevens' <a href="../reviews/unpv1.html">Unix Network Programming</a>, volume
1. You can also get that diagram in Postscript format off the web;
see the <a href="../"></a> section of the FAQ for a pointer.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, the term "packet" refers to data wrapped in a
TCP frame. As a TCP packet goes through the network from one peer
to another, the packet may be split into separate hardware frames,
or the data within multiple TCP frames may be coalesced.  This is as
opposed to the "datagram" sense of the term "packet," for an inviolable
block of data that is unchanged from sender to receiver.</p>

<h4>TCP Control Bits</h4>

<p>When a TCP implementation decides to send a packet of data to the
remote peer, it first wraps the data with 20-plus bytes of data called
the "header". Headers are an essential part of network protocols,
because they enable the participants in the network make decisions
regarding the data flowing over it. Every protocol adds headers (and
sometimes trailers) to your data. We won&rsquo;t discuss the TCP and
IP headers in detail here, as that&rsquo;s better left to books like
W. Richard Stevens'.</p>

<p>Within the header is a field that I will call the "control bits,"
for lack of a better term. The bits that interest us here are called
SYN, ACK, FIN and RST, for "synchronize," "acknowledge," "finish,"
and "reset," respectively. These bits are set in TCP packets for
the sole benefit of the remote peer&rsquo;s network stack &mdash;
that is, they are the machinery under the hood that most people never
have occasion to examine.</p>

<h4>The State/Transition Diagram</h4>

<p>Below is the state/transition diagram for the TCP protocol. The
states are in round-ended boxes, and the transitions are the labelled
arrows. The transitions show how how your program can make TCP move
from one state to another. It also shows how the remote peer can make
your stack change TCP states, and how you can recognize these changes
at the application level. Note that transition labels come from the
names of BSD sockets functions; although there are differences in
the Winsock API, the effects are the same at this level. (I apologize
for the so-so readability of the text in this image, but it&rsquo;s
already too big at 20K, so I&rsquo;m unwilling to make it any bigger
&mdash; if you want a pretty, readable diagram, get the Postscript
file and print your own copy.)</p>

<p class=lmargin align=center><img

diagram" width=420 height=502>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Understanding this diagram is really one of the keys to
understanding TCP, so let&rsquo;s go through a few exercises. But
first, you need to know about the <code>netstat</code> tool. This tool
comes with all Microsoft TCP/IP stacks, and probably others as well. It
is modelled after a Unix tool of the same name, with virtually the
same output. (The differences between each version of this tool are
slight enough that once you learn to use one, the rest are trivial
to pick up.)</p>

<p>The <code>netstat</code> tool is usually run from the command line,
often with the <code>-n</code> flag to make it faster. (<code>-n</code>
suppresses the DNS name lookups, displaying the raw address and port
numbers instead.) Another useful flag is the <code>-a</code> flag, which
shows "all" entries, including listeners. (This only works correctly
in Windows NT derivatives.)  It is also very helpful to use this tool
in combination with a "grep" tool &mdash; I recommend installing <a
href="http://cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>, which includes GNU grep.</p>

<p>Microsoft <code>netstat</code>s output four columns: the protocol
(e.g. TCP or UDP), the local address/port combination, the remote
address/port combination, and the current state of that connection. The
first three columns are self-explanatory, and are often collectively
called the "connection 5-tuple," which uniquely describes a given
TCP or UDP connection. The last column corresponds directly to the
states in the diagram above.</p>

<h4>A Micro-FAQ</h4>

<p>Now for those exercises I promised:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Problem:</b> From the default CLOSED state, how does a client
  program normally get to the ESTABLISHED state?<br><br>

  <b>Solution:</b> The client calls the <code>connect()</code> function
  (or similar), which causes TCP to send an empty packet with the
  SYN control bit set (SYN_SENT). The remote peer&rsquo;s stack sees
  this "synchronize" request, and sends back an empty packet with
  the SYN and ACK bits set (i.e. "I acknowledge your synchronize
  request"). When the client receives the SYN/ACK packet, it sends
  back an ACK packet, and reports a successful connection to the
  client program.<br><br>

  <li><b>Problem:</b> What is the normal TCP shutdown sequence?<br><br>

  <b>Solution:</b> The important thing to understand is that TCP is
  a bidirectional protocol. So, the connection is shut down in two
  identical stages, one for each "direction". One peer sends a packet
  with the FIN bit set, which the other end ACKnowledges; when the
  other end is also finished sending data, it sends out a FIN packet,
  which the other end ACKs, closing the connection.<br><br>

  <li><b>Problem:</b> What is the significance of the RST bit?<br><br>

  <b>Solution:</b> This is an abnormal close, also called "slamming
  the connection shut." It happens under several circumstances, but
  none of the common ones are documented in the Stevens diagram. Two
  of these cases you can cause from Winsock: the first method
  is to set <code>SO_LINGER</code> to 0 with <code>setsockopt()</code>
  and then call <code>closesocket()</code>. The second method is to call
  <code>shutdown()</code> with <code>how</code> equal to 2, optionally followed
  by a <code>closesocket()</code> call.<br><br>

  From the Winsock client level, the two other common RST occurrences
  are &ldquo;connection refused&rdquo; and &ldquo;remote peer
  terminated connection.&rdquo; The first happens when you try to
  connect to a port that isn&rsquo;t open on a remote machine. The
  second happens as a result of the remote peer using one of
  the two RST-forcing methods above; alternately, the application
  could have crashed, and the peer&rsquo;s stack sent out a RST for
  its connection. Another way this can happen is the remote peer
  catastrophically crashed, and then after the remote machine came
  back up, your program sent it a packet which the stack rightfully
  had no way of delivering, so it replied with a RST packet, because
  the connection&rsquo;s 5-tuple is now invalid.<br><br>

  Generally speaking, RST signals a problem of some kind: either
  something bad happened to the connection, or there&rsquo;s a bug
  somewhere. For example, some firewalls improperly use the RST bit to
  signal a closed connection. The solution, of course, is to replace
  the firewall product. <tt><b>:)</b></tt><br><br>

  <li><b>Problem:</b> Netstat shows lots of sockets in the TIME_WAIT
  state. What&rsquo;s wrong?<br><br>

  <b>Solution:</b> Nothing&rsquo;s wrong. TIME_WAIT is absolutely
  normal. If you go through the state-transition diagram above, you
  see that every socket that gets closed normally goes through this
  state after it&rsquo;s closed. The TIME_WAIT state is a safety
  mechanism, to catch stray packets for that connection after the
  connection is "officially" closed. Since the maximum time that such
  stray packets can exist is 2 times the "maximum segment lifetime"
  (the time for a packet to go from your machine to the remote peer
  and for the response to come back), the TIME_WAIT state lasts for 2 *
  MSL. The only tricky bit is, there is no easy way to estimate MSL on
  the fly, so stacks traditionally hard-code a value for it, from 15
  to 60 seconds. Thus, TIME_WAIT usually lasts 30-120 seconds.<br><br>

  <li><b>Problem:</b> My sockets keep getting into a FIN_WAIT_<i>x</i>
  state. What&rsquo;s wrong?<br><br>

  <b>Solution:</b> Either your program or the remote peer is not
  closing the socket properly. If you walk through the state-transition
  diagram above, you can see that FIN_WAIT_1 usually happens when the
  local program calls <code>shutdown()</code> with the "how" parameter set
  to 1 or SD_SEND, but the remote peer doesn&rsquo;t respond. Likewise
  FIN_WAIT_2 happens when the remote peer shuts down its sending half
  of the connection, and your program doesn&rsquo;t respond. Since
  FIN_WAIT states often last up to 10 minutes, it&rsquo;s well worth
  the effort to fix the problem that&rsquo;s causing these FIN_WAIT
  states. (The exact length of the state depends on the stack and
  the circumstances that got it into that state.)<br><br>

  <li><b>Problem:</b> Often my calls to <code>bind()</code> fail when I try to
  re-bind to a port that I was just using. What&rsquo;s wrong?<br><br>

  <b>Solution:</b> The socket is probably in one of the FIN_WAIT
  states or in the TIME_WAIT state. If it&rsquo;s a FIN_WAIT problem
  and you can&rsquo;t fix it, or if it&rsquo;s the normal TIME_WAIT
  state, the best thing to do is to redesign your program so that it
  doesn&rsquo;t need to keep re-binding. For example, a server program
  generally keeps its listener socket alive so that it doesn&rsquo;t
  have to keep re-binding it to the port; if you <code>closesocket()</code>
  the listener for some reason after each successful connection,
  your listener socket will go into the TIME_WAIT state for somewhere
  between 30 and 120 seconds, during which you won&rsquo;t be able
  to re-bind to that port. However, if you find that re-binding is
  absolutely necessary, setting the <code>SOREUSEADDR</code> option with
  <code>setsockopt()</code> will usually get you around the problem.<br><br>
</ol>

<h4>Tools for TCPers</h4>

<p>Below is a small batch file I find helpful in dealing with TCP state
issues, which I call &ldquo;showwait.bat.&rdquo; Basically, it shows
you the current WAIT states every second until you hit Ctrl-C.</p>

<pre>
    @echo off
    :loop
    netstat -na | grep WAIT
    sleep 1
    goto loop
</pre>

<p>This script assumes you have the &ldquo;grep&rdquo; and
&ldquo;sleep&rdquo; programs on your system, and that they&rsquo;re in
the PATH. The easiest way to get it is to install Cygwin, mentioned
above. (Are you maybe getting the impression that I don&rsquo;t
program only for Windows? Oh, noooo.... <tt><b>:)</b></tt> ) The Unix version
is slightly nicer, since the Bourne shell has real loops:</p>

<pre>
    #!/bin/sh
    while true; do
        netstat -a | grep WAIT
        sleep 1
    done
</pre>

<p>This runs fine on Cygwin, too.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s one problem with this tool: it only catches
problems with <tt>WAIT</tt> in their name. Less common states like
<tt>LAST_ACK</tt> and <tt>SYN_RCVD</tt> won&rsquo;t be seen by this
script. <tt>SYN_RCVD</tt> in particular signals serious problems if
it stays around for a prolonged amount of time, because it indicates
that a remote machine sent your machine a SYN packet, your machine
ACK&rsquo;d it, and the remote machine has failed to ACK your
SYN/ACK. Since this exchange typically only takes from a few tens
to a few hundreds of milliseconds, a persistent SYN_RCVD indicates
a badly-written network stack, or a very "crashy" computer. If you
see many of these states at once, it may mean you&rsquo;re under a
"SYN attack", one of several Denial of Service attacks that are going
around these days. At that point, it&rsquo;s time to break out the
network sniffer and start some detective work.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>The techniques and information in this article reflect the
basic mental tools that your organization needs to develop,
even if it&rsquo;s just appointing a single &ldquo;networking
guru&rdquo; who will master this material, and become a resource
for the other developers in the company. This knowledge
is very widely useful; for example, it can make reading <a
href="../resources/debugging.html">sniffer</a> dumps less painful and
more productive. Also, these techniques can reasonably be applied by
technicians working with knowledgeable users over the phone to gather
information about failures in your program that otherwise would get
logged as random failures.</p>
