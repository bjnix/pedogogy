Info: *******************************************************************
Info: Running Quartus II Fitter
    Info: Version 9.1 Build 222 10/21/2009 SJ Full Version
    Info: Processing started: Thu Mar 17 12:14:13 2011
Info: Command: quartus_fit --read_settings_files=off --write_settings_files=off part2 -c part2
Info: Parallel compilation is enabled and will use 2 of the 2 processors detected
Info: Selected device EP2C35F672C6 for design "part2"
Info: Low junction temperature is 0 degrees C
Info: High junction temperature is 85 degrees C
Info: Fitter is performing an Auto Fit compilation, which may decrease Fitter effort to reduce compilation time
Info: Device migration not selected. If you intend to use device migration later, you may need to change the pin assignments as they may be incompatible with other devices
    Info: Device EP2C50F672C6 is compatible
    Info: Device EP2C70F672C6 is compatible
Info: Fitter converted 3 user pins into dedicated programming pins
    Info: Pin ~ASDO~ is reserved at location E3
    Info: Pin ~nCSO~ is reserved at location D3
    Info: Pin ~LVDS150p/nCEO~ is reserved at location AE24
Info: Timing-driven compilation is using the Classic Timing Analyzer
Info: Timing requirements not specified -- quality metrics such as performance and power consumption may be sacrificed to reduce compilation time.
Info: Starting register packing
Info: Finished register packing
    Extra Info: No registers were packed into other blocks
