CVE Name: CVE-2008-3431	


*Vulnerability Description*

Virtualization technologies allow users to run different operating
systems simultaneously on top of the same set of underlying physical

hardware. This provides several benefits to end users and organizations,
including efficiency gains in the use of hardware resources, reduction
of operational costs, dynamic re-allocation of computing resources and

rapid deployment and configuration of software development and testing
environments.

VirtualBox is an open source virtualization technology project
originally developed by Innotek, a software company based in Germany.


In February 2008 Sun Microsystems announced the acquisition of Innotek
[1] and VirtualBox was integrated into Sun's xVM family of
virtualization technologies. In May 2008, Sun Microsystems announced
that the number of downloads of the open source VirtualBox software

package passed the five million mark [2].

When used on a Windows Host Operating System VirtualBox installs a
kernel driver ('VBoxDrv.sys') to control virtualization of guest
Operating Systems.


An input validation vulnerability was discovered within VirtualBox's
'VBoxDrv.sys' driver that could allow an attacker, with local but
un-privileged access to a host where VirtualBox is installed, to execute

arbitrary code within the kernel of the Windows host operating system
and to gain complete control of a
